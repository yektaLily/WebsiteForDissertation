Let’s visualize how the themes of the papers have changed across the years. I will first generate a bar plot that fills the bars at each year (as a categorical factor) with proportions of themes in that year. This is an aggregation that happens under the hood, and using position = \"fill\" will actually make sure all the bars consider things relative to eachother, filling the full 100% of the bar.\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(Year), fill = DecisionTheme)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(fill = \"Theme\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Count\") +\n  fill_palette(\"Set3\")\n\nTo see how things move/flow over the years, a line chart is a great idea:\n\ndf %&gt;%\n    dplyr::count(DecisionTheme, Year) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = n, color = DecisionTheme, group = DecisionTheme)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(fill = \"Theme\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Count\") +\n  fill_palette(\"Dark2\")\n\nFor analysis, I will need to convert the data to long format. Since I want to avoid making it too big, I’ll do this separately for each key variable.\n\ntheory_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = THEORY1:THEORY4,\n        names_to = \"THEORY_NAME\", \n        values_to = \"THEORY\"\n    ) \n\nmethod_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = METHOD1:METHOD4,\n        names_to = \"METHODNAME\", \n        values_to = \"METHOD\"\n    ) \n\nlimit_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = LIMIT1:LIMIT3,\n        names_to = \"LIMITNAME\", \n        values_to = \"LIMIT\"\n    ) \n\nfac_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = F1:F9,\n        names_to = \"FACNAME\",\n        values_to = \"FAC\"\n    )\n\nfac_NS_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = FNS1:FNS4,\n        names_to = \"FAC_NS_NAME\",\n        values_to = \"FAC_NS\"\n    )\n\nfactors_based_on_themes &lt;- df %&gt;% pivot_longer(\n    cols = F1_THEME:F9_THEME,\n    names_to = \"FAC_THEMES_NAMES\",\n    values_to = \"FACTHEME\"\n)\n\nRemove all the empty rows:\n\ntheory_long &lt;- theory_long %&gt;% filter(THEORY != \"\") #\nmethod_long &lt;- method_long %&gt;% filter(METHOD != \"\") #\nlimit_long &lt;- limit_long %&gt;% filter(LIMIT != \"\") #\nfac_long &lt;- fac_long %&gt;% filter(FAC != \"\")\nfac_NS_long &lt;- fac_NS_long %&gt;% filter(FAC_NS != \"\")\n\nAdd factor scores to the long factors and non-signficant factors’ data:\n\nfac_long &lt;- merge(fac_long, factor_scores, by = \"FAC\", all = T)\n\n\nfactor_scores &lt;- factor_scores %&gt;% mutate(FAC_NS = FAC) %&gt;% dplyr::select(FAC_NS,Score_Sig, Score_NOT_Sig)\nfac_NS_long &lt;- merge(fac_NS_long, factor_scores, by = \"FAC_NS\", all = T)\n\n\n\n\nNow, I want to explore the interactions between the following properties: themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors. Some questions that can be answered from such an analysis are:\n\nAre there notable differences in the distribution of themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors.across years?\nAre themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, and non-significant factors significantly associated with specific technologies?\nAre there significant differences in sample sizes across themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nDo research types vary significantly among different themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nAre there significant differences in methods used across themes, theories, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nAre the significant factors identified notably different among themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, years, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nAre the non-significant factors identified notably different among themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, and technologies?\n\nTo do this, I will first decide if further investigation is even worthwhile. First, I will use ANOVA to figure out if there are significant differences between groups of the same variable. That is, are themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, technologies, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, and non-significant factors actually different across the dataset?\n\nbuild_anova &lt;- function(nameOfCol){\n    counts_df &lt;- df %&gt;% count({{nameOfCol}}) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n))\n\n    counts_df_long &lt;- data.frame(\n        Group = rep(as.character(counts_df[[1]]), times = counts_df$n),\n        Value = unlist(lapply(counts_df$n, function(x) seq_len(x)))\n    )\n\n    anova_result &lt;- aov(Value ~ Group, data = counts_df_long)\n    return(summary(anova_result))\n}\n\nThemes are significantly different.\n\nbuild_anova(DecisionTheme)\n\nSo, let’s see how they differ across other factors - starting with the ones that do not require pivoting the dataframe! (Year, Tech, SampleSizeBin, ResearchType). This time, I will use a \\chi^2 test of independence.\n\nbuild_contingency_table &lt;- function(nameOfCol){\n    data_combine &lt;- df %&gt;% group_by(DecisionTheme) %&gt;% count({{nameOfCol}}) \n\n    contingency_table &lt;- xtabs(n ~ DecisionTheme + {{nameOfCol}}, data = data_combine)\n    chi_sq_result &lt;- chisq.test(contingency_table)\n    chi_sq_result\n}\n\n\n#build_contingency_table(SampleSizeBin)\n\nYou can also calculate the Cramer V:\n\ntable(is.na(df$SampleSizeBin))\n\n\n#cramerV(build_contingency_table(SampleSizeBin))",

    "text": "1 ### The Inner Workings of Mobile Banking Adoption: A Systematic Literature Review of Intrinsic Factors\nDespite extensive research on m-banking adoption, a clear framework categorizing user-specific influences is still missing.\nAfter investigating the m-banking adoption literature, I found that uniform definitions for factors 1 influencing m-banking adoption was lacking. Furthermore, there was an over-reliance on only a few factors and theoretical frameworks. This prompted the undertaking of the SLR study in study 1. To address the problem of lack of uniform definitions, I categorized adoption factors based on context and impact. This way, using group/category membership help identify similarities between factors. Thus making definitions more cohesive.\nSeveral studies support the idea that categorization helps in defining and understanding concepts more easily. Research suggests that categorization plays a crucial role in defining concepts, moving from a classical view (fixed definitions) to a probabilistic view where categorization helps in making sense of concepts based on shared characteristics Medin (1989). Categorization enables more effective organization and processing of information which are essential for learning new concepts (zentallCATEGORIZATIONCONCEPTLEARNING2002?).\nTechnology adoption factors are complex and often belong to multiple categories. Because of this, studies have never explicitly categorized factors across the board. I adopt a broad approach to classifying factors, focusing on two key dimensions of decision-making based on how they relate to the user: Intrinsic and Extrinsic. In the context of m-banking adoption, intrinsic factors discuss how individuals evaluate an m-banking application (Often shortened to “app”) internally — based on perceptions, goals, pressure felt from other people’s judgment, and emotions. Extrinsic factors, on the other hand, refer to the apps’ measurable features, such as performance and functionality. Since extrinsic factors are easy to quantify and experienced similarly across the board, they are also straightforward to study. Thus, I focused on intrinsic factors. Because intrinsic factors relate to so many different inner processes (mentioned above), I further categorized them into four main groups:\n\nPerceptive, which are based on beliefs and perceptions.\nPersonal, which are based on individual motivations and traits.\nSocial, which are based on the impact of others on the decision-maker.\nPsychological, which are based on based on cognitive, emotional and mental processes.\n\nThis categorization provides a useful context-specific grouping. Following this, a systematic search of the m-banking literature for intrinsic factors was carried out. Scientific articles gathered were given themes using text-mining techniques – specifically, lda for Topic Modeling. Some of these themes matched my categorization, as well. I also extended prior SLR studies by using statistical techniques – specifically, anova – to mathematically validate my findings. My results provide a strong empirical foundation for future researchers to do context-focused investigation.\nThe Outcome of this study is to help enhance the understanding of intrinsic factors, highlight underutilized methodologies, and identify research gaps. Additionally, I highlight the dominance of certain theoretical models while advocating for greater exploration of under-studied theories and methods. My findings show notable geographical and study-design biases, particularly longitudinal research in developed nations. My categorized framework helps scholars identify intrinsic factors, relevant theories, and research gaps, which promotes targeted future research.\nFor practitioners and policymakers, I recommend designing emotionally engaging apps, ensuring transparent risk communication, and educating users on safe practices. These steps enhance m-banking adoption and effectiveness.\n\n1.1 The Relationship Between Mental Health and Mobile Banking Adoption: Evidence from Canada\nFollowing the work of the previous study, I focused on intrinsic factors. One of the factors I found to be under-explored in the literature was mental health.\nPsychological factors are comparatively less-studied across the m-banking literature Venkatesh et al. (2012), Zou et al. (2023-05, 2023), Tiwari et al. (2021-12, 2021). I verified this further doing a quick preliminary search on Web-of-Science. Using the following search query returned 1,067 studies with no filters set on the results: !30(“mobile banking” OR “mbanking” OR “m-banking”) AND (“adoption”) When changing the search query to find studies specifically on psychological factors, the total number of studies returned were 157, which is about 14\\% of the total. The new search query was: !30\\parbox0.8 (“mobile banking” OR “mbanking” OR “m-banking”) AND \\ (“adoption”) AND (“affective” OR “psychological” OR “affect based” OR “affect-based” OR “emotional” OR “cognitive” OR “mental” OR “personal”)  \\ Using the same search queries in Scopus, 753 results were returned for the first, and 101 in the second search (13.4\\%). It is clear that only a small portion of the literature in m-banking adoption is focused on psychological factors.\nIn this study, I investigated the direct and moderated effect of mh on m-banking adoption. Moderators were extracted from theories in technology adoption or from literature related to mental health: rs, sd, and sns. I used a fixed effect logistic regression model grouped based on Canadian provinces following the cluster sampling design of my dataset. The results showed that mental health significantly and negatively affects m-banking adoption: better mental health outcomes were associated with lower likelihood of m-banking adoption. I did not find sufficient evidence for the moderating effects.\n%———————————————————————- Device Divide: Unpacking Mobile Banking Adoption Differences for Smartphones and Smart Wearable Devices -section-p3 %———————————————————————- Moving on from focusing only on smartphones, I decided to do a comparative study considering newer devices used in m-banking. One of the findings of my SLR study from Section -section-p2 was that few comparative studies exist in general, and studies that focus on various tools used for m-banking are increasingly important. In this chapter, I examined the nuances of m-banking adoption across two mobile devices: smartphones and smart wearable devices. I investigated the impact of the following factors: trust, perceived security, perceived value (time savings), and demographic variables. Demographic factors are important as numerous studies identify these (e.g., age, gender, income, and education) as key factors influencing m-banking adoption Chawla & Joshi (2018), lyInternetBankingAdoption2022e.\nThe results from this chapter are device-specific insights. This study also refines existing technology adoption models. Additionally, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to compare behavioral differences between smartphone and smart wearable users in the context of m-banking. I found that trust impacts smartphone users more strongly, while wearable users prioritize time efficiency. Users perceived smartphones as more secure. Demographic factors such as age, education, and gender exhibited varying influences based on device type as well.\n\n\n1.2 References"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This study is the second chapter of my Dissertation, “Essays on Mobile Banking Adoption”. I hope it provides a clear framework for categorizing the various factors that influence mobile banking (m-banking) adoption, which have lacked uniform definitions in previous research. Really, what even is perceived value of something? If depends on so many things and the context, and from problem to problem and person to person, it could be totally different! Digging deep into the literature, this was one thing that was really challenging and I only found other studies saying the same thing… but no one really addressed it. There’s also an over-reliance on a limited number of factors and theoretical frameworks in existing m-banking adoption literature. Like, we get it, technology acceptance model is very cool and strong! We know it works! Why are people still trying to show that it works?\nHere, in an attempt to offer some relief to researchers from the above issues, I introduce a novel categorization of adoption factors - breaking all of them into two main dimensions:\nDepending on how it relates to the decision maker. That basically means: is the decision you are making (about adoption of m-banking app) being influenced by factors (things) outside of your head that everyone else experiences (almost) the same as you do? Or is it more complicated than that, and it has to do with who you are, what you want, and how you perceive things? Those are external (to the user) and internal (to the user) factors. The focus of this study is on intrinsic factors, which relate to how individuals internally evaluate an m-banking application based on their perceptions (Perceptive Factors), goals and motivations (Personal Factors), social pressures (Social Factors), and emotions/mood (Psychological Factors). In contrast, extrinsic factors are measurable features of the app, like performance and functionality, which are generally easier to quantify and study - (almost) everyone experiences these things the same way.\nTo be even more detailed, I break intrinsic factors into further divisions - four main sub-categories:\nThis structured categorization is to clarify the meaning of some factors, and hopefully enable more focused research, as well as highlight overlooked patterns in the literature. To introduce these factors, I do a systematic literature review of m-banking adoption with these factors in mind. Here’s another novelty of this chapter: I used text-mining techniques — nothing fancy, just Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and a neat custom algorithm — to assign themes to collected scientific articles. Because of a colleagues comments, I also decided to apply some statistical techniques, to validate the findings empirically. I have a large enough dataset, so why not?\nThis should provide a robust foundation for future context-focused research, help identify gaps, and advocate for the exploration of under-studied theories and methods in m-banking adoption.",

The reason is that it was taking so long and my computer simply did not have the capacity to handle it. I also didn’t have the time to find a fix for it, but there are a bunch of commented-out code from chatGPT that I was playing around with.\nSo, we now have a dictionary with the factors and their theme, and a corpus of text of all papers in the dataset. What I’m going to do here is: * Count all the words total_words in each paper * Count the instances of each word (factor) in theme_of_words_cleaned in each paper * Each word’s count adds 1 point to its corresponding theme’s “weight score” * Take for example the word emotion and I said the theme for this word is psychological. If emotion shows up 10 times in paper 1, paper 1’s dictionary of weights has a weight of 10 for (divided by the total number of words) psychological.\n\nresults = []\ncount_words_df = pd.DataFrame(results)\n\n\nfor doc_id, text in papers_cleaned.items():\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    word_counts = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for token in doc:\n        for group, keywords in theme_of_words_cleaned.items():\n            if token.text.lower() in keywords:\n                word_counts[group] += 1\n\n    total_words = len(doc)\n    group_weights = {f\"{group}_w\": count / total_words for group, count in word_counts.items()}\n    max_weight = max(group_weights.values(), default=0)\n    theme = max(group_weights, key=group_weights.get).replace(\"_w\", \"\") if max_weight &gt; 0 else None\n\n    result = {\"doc_id\": doc_id, **word_counts, **group_weights, \"theme\": theme, \"max_weight\": max_weight}\n    results.append(result)\n\n\nfor group in theme_of_words_cleaned.keys():\n    if group not in count_words_df.columns:\n        count_words_df[group] = 0\n    if f\"{group}_w\" not in count_words_df.columns:\n        count_words_df[f\"{group}_w\"] = 0.0\n\ncount_words_df.head()\n\n\nThis is still very basic, though because it’s only based on the factors which may not be fully representative. So, I do this again using keywords in addition to the factors. These are keywords that were selected by the authors as well as information extracted from Web of Science \\BibTeX file.\n\ncols_toPick = ['K1','K2','K3','K4','K5','K6','K7','K8','K9','K10','F1','F2','F3','F4','F5','F6','F7','F8','F9']\n\nkeywordsDf = df2.loc[:,cols_toPick]\n\n# flatten the dataframe to a list \nkeywords_across_db = keywordsDf.values.flatten().tolist()\n\n# there are 2,717 words here \nprint(\"number of words (factors and keywords) in total \", len(keywords_across_db))\n\n# making sure there are no empty/NaN/Null values \nkeywords_across_db = [x for x in keywords_across_db if x not in [None, \"\", ' ', 'NaN'] and not (isinstance(x, float) and math.isnan(x))]\n\n# making sure there are no duplicates (set takes care of this)\nkeywords_across_db_nodup_cleaned = list(set(keywords_across_db))\n\n# convert the list into a dictionary temporarily, then convert it to a dataframe \ntemp = {'Keyword': keywords_across_db_nodup_cleaned}\nkeywords_themes_df = pd.DataFrame(temp, columns=['Keyword'])\n\n# go back to the theme_of_words_cleaned and find each keyword's theme \nkeywords_themes_dic = {keyword: theme for theme, keywords in theme_of_words_cleaned.items() for keyword in keywords}\n\n# This is just a dataframe view of the keywords with their respective theme \nkeywords_themes_df['Theme'] = keywords_themes_df['Keyword'].map(keywords_themes_dic)\n\n# if the theme is empty, give it \"Generic\" - that means these keywords weren't in the list of important words that we picked themes for \nkeywords_themes_df['Theme'] = keywords_themes_df['Theme'].apply(lambda x: 'Generic' if pd.isna(x) or x == ' ' else x)\n\nkeywords_themes_df.head()",

The reason is that it was taking so long and my computer simply did not have the capacity to handle it. I also didn’t have the time to find a fix for it, but there are a bunch of commented-out code from chatGPT that I was playing around with.\nSo, we now have a dictionary with the factors and their theme, and a corpus of text of all papers in the dataset. What I’m going to do here is:\n\nCount all the words total_words in each paper\nCount the instances of each word (factor) in theme_of_words_cleaned in each paper\nEach word’s count adds 1 point to its corresponding theme’s “weight score”\n\nTake for example the word emotion and I said the theme for this word is psychological. If emotion shows up 10 times in paper 1, paper 1’s dictionary of weights has a weight of 10 for (divided by the total number of words) psychological.\n\n\n\nresults = []\ncount_words_df = pd.DataFrame(results)\n\n\nfor doc_id, text in papers_cleaned.items():\n    doc = nlp(text)\n    word_counts = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for token in doc:\n        for group, keywords in theme_of_words_cleaned.items():\n            if token.text.lower() in keywords:\n                word_counts[group] += 1\n\n    total_words = len(doc)\n    group_weights = {f\"{group}_w\": count / total_words for group, count in word_counts.items()}\n    max_weight = max(group_weights.values(), default=0)\n    theme = max(group_weights, key=group_weights.get).replace(\"_w\", \"\") if max_weight &gt; 0 else None\n\n    result = {\"doc_id\": doc_id, **word_counts, **group_weights, \"theme\": theme, \"max_weight\": max_weight}\n    results.append(result)\n\n\nfor group in theme_of_words_cleaned.keys():\n    if group not in count_words_df.columns:\n        count_words_df[group] = 0\n    if f\"{group}_w\" not in count_words_df.columns:\n        count_words_df[f\"{group}_w\"] = 0.0\n\ncount_words_df.head()\n\n\nThis is still very basic, though because it’s only based on the factors which may not be fully representative. So, I do this again using keywords in addition to the factors. These are keywords that were selected by the authors as well as information extracted from Web of Science \\BibTeX file.\n\ncols_toPick = ['K1','K2','K3','K4','K5','K6','K7','K8','K9','K10','F1','F2','F3','F4','F5','F6','F7','F8','F9']\n\nkeywordsDf = df2.loc[:,cols_toPick]\n\n# flatten the dataframe to a list \nkeywords_across_db = keywordsDf.values.flatten().tolist()\n\n# there are 2,717 words here \nprint(\"number of words (factors and keywords) in total \", len(keywords_across_db))\n\n# making sure there are no empty/NaN/Null values \nkeywords_across_db = [x for x in keywords_across_db if x not in [None, \"\", ' ', 'NaN'] and not (isinstance(x, float) and math.isnan(x))]\n\n# making sure there are no duplicates (set takes care of this)\nkeywords_across_db_nodup_cleaned = list(set(keywords_across_db))\n\n# convert the list into a dictionary temporarily, then convert it to a dataframe \ntemp = {'Keyword': keywords_across_db_nodup_cleaned}\nkeywords_themes_df = pd.DataFrame(temp, columns=['Keyword'])\n\n# go back to the theme_of_words_cleaned and find each keyword's theme \nkeywords_themes_dic = {keyword: theme for theme, keywords in theme_of_words_cleaned.items() for keyword in keywords}\n\n# This is just a dataframe view of the keywords with their respective theme \nkeywords_themes_df['Theme'] = keywords_themes_df['Keyword'].map(keywords_themes_dic)\n\n# if the theme is empty, give it \"Generic\" - that means these keywords weren't in the list of important words that we picked themes for \nkeywords_themes_df['Theme'] = keywords_themes_df['Theme'].apply(lambda x: 'Generic' if pd.isna(x) or x == ' ' else x)\n\nkeywords_themes_df.head()\n\n\nI’m gonna get rid of all the Generic keywords, so keeping a copy of this dataframe:\n\nkeywords_themes_df_withGenerics = keywords_themes_df.copy()\n\nkeywords_themes_df['Theme'] = keywords_themes_df['Theme'].apply(lambda x: 'Generic' if pd.isna(x) or x == ' ' else x)\n\n# everything but generic \nkeywords_themes_df = keywords_themes_df.loc[keywords_themes_df['Theme'] != 'Generic']\n\n# flatten it to build a vocabulary \nwords_acrossAll_nonGeneric = keywords_themes_df['Keyword'].values.flatten().tolist()\n\n# making sure no null values were generated \nwords_acrossAll_nonGeneric = [x for x in words_acrossAll_nonGeneric if x not in [None, \"\", ' ', 'NaN'] and not (isinstance(x, float) and math.isnan(x))]\n\n# making sure there are no dulicates (233 words total)\nwords_acrossAll_nonGeneric = list(set(words_acrossAll_nonGeneric))\n\n\n\nTheme Assignment\nI will now use the custom TF-IDF class to generate a TF-IDF matrix.

Let’s visualize how the themes of the papers have changed across the years. I will first generate a bar plot that fills the bars at each year (as a categorical factor) with proportions of themes in that year. This is an aggregation that happens under the hood, and using position = \"fill\" will actually make sure all the bars consider things relative to eachother, filling the full 100% of the bar.\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(Year), fill = DecisionTheme)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(fill = \"Theme\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Count\") +\n  fill_palette(\"Set3\")\n\nTo see how things move/flow over the years, a line chart is a great idea:\n\ndf %&gt;%\n    dplyr::count(DecisionTheme, Year) %&gt;%\n    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(Year), y = n, color = DecisionTheme, group = DecisionTheme)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(fill = \"Theme\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Count\") +\n  fill_palette(\"Dark2\")\n\nFor analysis, I will need to convert the data to long format. Since I want to avoid making it too big, I’ll do this separately for each key variable.\n\ntheory_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = THEORY1:THEORY4,\n        names_to = \"THEORY_NAME\", \n        values_to = \"THEORY\"\n    ) \n\nmethod_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = METHOD1:METHOD4,\n        names_to = \"METHODNAME\", \n        values_to = \"METHOD\"\n    ) \n\nlimit_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = LIMIT1:LIMIT3,\n        names_to = \"LIMITNAME\", \n        values_to = \"LIMIT\"\n    ) \n\nfac_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = F1:F9,\n        names_to = \"FACNAME\",\n        values_to = \"FAC\"\n    )\n\nfac_NS_long &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    pivot_longer(\n        cols = FNS1:FNS4,\n        names_to = \"FAC_NS_NAME\",\n        values_to = \"FAC_NS\"\n    )\n\nfactors_based_on_themes &lt;- df %&gt;% pivot_longer(\n    cols = F1_THEME:F9_THEME,\n    names_to = \"FAC_THEMES_NAMES\",\n    values_to = \"FACTHEME\"\n)\n\nRemove all the empty rows:\n\ntheory_long &lt;- theory_long %&gt;% filter(THEORY != \"\") #\nmethod_long &lt;- method_long %&gt;% filter(METHOD != \"\") #\nlimit_long &lt;- limit_long %&gt;% filter(LIMIT != \"\") #\nfac_long &lt;- fac_long %&gt;% filter(FAC != \"\")\nfac_NS_long &lt;- fac_NS_long %&gt;% filter(FAC_NS != \"\")\n\nAdd factor scores to the long factors and non-signficant factors’ data:\n\nfac_long &lt;- merge(fac_long, factor_scores, by = \"FAC\", all = T)\n\n\nfactor_scores &lt;- factor_scores %&gt;% mutate(FAC_NS = FAC) %&gt;% dplyr::select(FAC_NS,Score_Sig, Score_NOT_Sig)\nfac_NS_long &lt;- merge(fac_NS_long, factor_scores, by = \"FAC_NS\", all = T)\n\n\n\n\nNow, I want to explore the interactions between the following properties: themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors. Some questions that can be answered from such an analysis are:\n\nAre there notable differences in the distribution of themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors.across years?\nAre themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, and non-significant factors significantly associated with specific technologies?\nAre there significant differences in sample sizes across themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nDo research types vary significantly among different themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nAre there significant differences in methods used across themes, theories, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nAre the significant factors identified notably different among themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, years, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nAre the non-significant factors identified notably different among themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, and technologies?\n\nTo do this, I will first decide if further investigation is even worthwhile. First, I will use ANOVA to figure out if there are significant differences between groups of the same variable. That is, are themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, technologies, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, and non-significant factors actually different across the dataset?\n\nbuild_anova &lt;- function(nameOfCol){\n    counts_df &lt;- df %&gt;% count({{nameOfCol}}) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n))\n\n    counts_df_long &lt;- data.frame(\n        Group = rep(as.character(counts_df[[1]]), times = counts_df$n),\n        Value = unlist(lapply(counts_df$n, function(x) seq_len(x)))\n    )\n\n    anova_result &lt;- aov(Value ~ Group, data = counts_df_long)\n    return(summary(anova_result))\n}\n\nThemes are significantly different.\n\nbuild_anova(DecisionTheme)\n\nSo, let’s see how they differ across other factors - starting with the ones that do not require pivoting the dataframe! (Year, Tech, SampleSizeBin, ResearchType). This time, I will use a \\chi^2 test of independence.\n\nbuild_contingency_table &lt;- function(nameOfCol){\n    data_combine &lt;- df %&gt;% group_by(DecisionTheme) %&gt;% count({{nameOfCol}}) \n\n    contingency_table &lt;- xtabs(n ~ DecisionTheme + {{nameOfCol}}, data = data_combine)\n    chi_sq_result &lt;- chisq.test(contingency_table)\n    chi_sq_result\n}\n\n\n#build_contingency_table(SampleSizeBin)\n\nYou can also calculate the Cramer V:\n\ntable(is.na(df$SampleSizeBin))\n\n\n#cramerV(build_contingency_table(SampleSizeBin))",

I will first generate a bar plot that fills the bars at each year (as a categorical factor) with proportions of themes in that year.

Some questions that can be answered from such an analysis are:\n\nAre there notable differences in the distribution of themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors.across years?\nAre themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, and non-significant factors significantly associated with specific technologies?\nAre there significant differences in sample sizes across themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nDo research types vary significantly among different themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nAre there significant differences in methods used across themes, theories, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nAre the significant factors identified notably different among themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, years, research types, sample sizes, technologies, and non-significant factors?\nAre the non-significant factors identified notably different among themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, and technologies?\n\nTo do this, I will first decide if further investigation is even worthwhile. First, I will use ANOVA to figure out if there are significant differences between groups of the same variable. That is, are themes, theories, methodologies, limitations, technologies, factors, years, research types, sample sizes, and non-significant factors actually different across the dataset?\n\nbuild_anova &lt;- function(nameOfCol){\n    counts_df &lt;- df %&gt;% count({{nameOfCol}}) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n))\n\n    counts_df_long &lt;- data.frame(\n        Group = rep(as.character(counts_df[[1]]), times = counts_df$n),\n        Value = unlist(lapply(counts_df$n, function(x) seq_len(x)))\n    )\n\n    anova_result &lt;- aov(Value ~ Group, data = counts_df_long)\n    return(summary(anova_result))\n}\n\n\nPaper Themes\nThemes are significantly different.\n\nbuild_anova(DecisionTheme)\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    \nGroup         6   7489  1248.2   15.05 3.69e-13 ***\nResiduals   136  11280    82.9                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nSo, let’s see how they differ across other factors - starting with the ones that do not require pivoting the dataframe! (Year, Tech, SampleSizeBin, ResearchType). This time, I will use a \\chi^2 test of independence.\n\ncombine_data &lt;- function(nameOfCol){\n    data_combine &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    group_by(DecisionTheme) %&gt;% \n    count({{nameOfCol}}) \n\n    return(data_combine)\n}\n\n\nchisq.test(\n    xtabs(n ~ DecisionTheme + Year, \n         data = combine_data(Year))\n)\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  xtabs(n ~ DecisionTheme + Year, data = combine_data(Year))\nX-squared = 44.414, df = 36, p-value = 0.1585\n\n\nI do this for SampleSizeBin, ResearchType, and Tech too. The results are:\n\n\n\nVariable\n\\chi^2\ndf\np-value\n\n\n\n\nYear\n44.414\n36\n0.159\n\n\nTech\n102.59\n48\n0.002^{**}\n\n\nSampleSizeBin\n8.6582\n18\n0.967\n\n\nResearchType\n127.06\n90\n0.006^{**}\n\n\n\nFor the variables that have multiple columns, I first pivot the dataframe and then do the test. For example, this is how I do it for non-significant factors:\n\ncombine_data_longFormat &lt;- function(startCol, stopCol){\n    longlong &lt;- df %&gt;% pivot_longer(\n        cols = {{startCol}}:{{stopCol}},\n        names_to = \"NAMES\",\n        values_to = \"THINGS\") %&gt;% \n    filter(THINGS != \"\" & THINGS != \" \") # no null values \n\n    combined_df &lt;- longlong %&gt;% \n        group_by(DecisionTheme) %&gt;%\n        count(THINGS) \n\n    return(combined_df)\n}\n\ncombined_df &lt;- combine_data_longFormat(FNS1, FNS4)\nchisq.test(xtabs(n ~ DecisionTheme + THINGS,\n           data = combined_df))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  xtabs(n ~ DecisionTheme + THINGS, data = combined_df)\nX-squared = 207.87, df = 180, p-value = 0.0758\n\n\nDoing this for Theory, Methods, Limitatiosn, Factors, as well as factor Themes I have:\n\n\n\nVariable\n\\chi^2\ndf\np-value\n\n\n\n\nTheories\n251.84\n252\n0.491\n\n\nMethods\n272.02\n240\n0.076\n\n\nLimits\n89.327\n84\n0.325\n\n\nFactors\n1461.4\n1386\n0.078\n\n\nFactorThemes\n139.26\n36\n&lt; 0.001^{***}\n\n\nNS.Factors\n207.87\n180\n0.076\n\n\n\nWhich basically means only technology, research type and factor themes are kind of related to overall paper themes. Let’s dig deeper.\n\nPaper Themes vs Technology\nI first make sure the rows where Tech is empty are filled with mobile banking (as the most frequent technology, because the papers were specifically m-banking related).\n\ndf %&gt;% group_by(DecisionTheme) %&gt;% \n    mutate(Tech = ifelse(\n        Tech == \"\",\n        \"mobile banking\",\n        Tech\n    )) %&gt;% count(Tech) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(DecisionTheme), fill = Tech)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(fill = \"Tech\",\n       x = \"Themes\",\n       y = \" \") +\n  fill_palette(\"Set3\") + \n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = \"bold\"), \n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket studies cover the broadest range of technologies. This is because studies on variations of m-banking like m-wallets and smart wearables fall under the Market category, influencing the theme distribution across technologies. To confirm that this effect is driven by Market studies, I exclude them and rerun the above test:\n\ntemp_combine_data &lt;- df %&gt;% \n    filter(DecisionTheme != 'market') %&gt;% \n    group_by(DecisionTheme) %&gt;% \n    count(Tech) \n\nchisq.test(xtabs(\n    n ~ DecisionTheme + Tech,\n    data = temp_combine_data\n))\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  xtabs(n ~ DecisionTheme + Tech, data = temp_combine_data)\nX-squared = 19.629, df = 20, p-value = 0.4813\n\n\nThe p-value of 0.481 means we cannot reject the null hypothesis of \\chi^2 test of independence. That means, Paper Themes and Technology studied are independent when we set aside Market studies. How about research type? First, a little house keeping for the data with respect to research type: I simply rename a few columns for easier visualization.\n\n\nPaper Themes vs Research Type\n\ndf %&gt;% group_by(DecisionTheme) %&gt;% \n    mutate(\n        ResearchType = case_when(\n               ResearchType == \"survey quantitative\" ~ \"survey analysis\",\n               ResearchType == \"survey, empirical\" ~ \"survey analysis\",\n               ResearchType == \"survey\" ~ \"survey analysis\",\n               ResearchType == \"conceptual qualitative\" ~ \"conceptual\",\n               ResearchType == \"mixed method qualquant\" ~ \"mixed method\",\n               .default = ResearchType\n    )) %&gt;% \n    filter(!is.na(ResearchType) & ResearchType != \"\") %&gt;% \n    count(ResearchType) %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(DecisionTheme), fill = ResearchType)) +\n          geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n          theme_minimal() +\n          labs(fill = \"Research Type\",\n               x = \"Themes\",\n               y = \" \") +\n          fill_palette(\"Set3\") + \n          theme(\n            axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = \"bold\"), \n          )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatterns between research types and themes are less distinct. Market and Personal studies show the least research type diversity, while Psychological studies exhibit the most. Comparative research appears only in Cultural and Demographic studies. For themes of factors, I will use a different type of visualization (not filling the bars, but wanting to see the difference separately):\n\n\nPaper Themes vs Sig/Non-Significant Factors\n\nlonglong &lt;- df %&gt;% pivot_longer(\n        cols = F1_THEME:F9_THEME,\n        names_to = \"NAMES\",\n        values_to = \"THINGS\") %&gt;% \n        # don't include external variables \n    filter(THINGS != \"\" & THINGS != \" \" & THINGS != \"external\") %&gt;% # these changes are for visualization \n    mutate(THINGS = str_to_title(THINGS), DecisionTheme = str_to_title(DecisionTheme))\n\nlonglongGroup &lt;- longlong %&gt;% group_by(DecisionTheme) %&gt;% count(THINGS) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n))\n\nggplot(longlongGroup, aes(x = as.factor(DecisionTheme), y = n, fill = as.factor(THINGS))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(fill = \"Theme of Factors\", x = \"Theme\", y = \"Proportions\") +\n  fill_palette(\"Accent\") + \n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, face = \"bold\")) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket studies contain the most diverse set of factors influencing m-banking, likely due to device differences. This suggests that variations of the same technology (e.g., m-wallets, m-payment devices) introduce different influencing factors. A comparative study between devices could provide valuable insights. Market-specific factors appear only in Social and Perceptive themes (aside from Market itself). This suggests that Social and Perceptive studies are the only studies that are considering device differences. Therefore, future research should expand the understanding of device differences in m-banking adoption by conducting thematically different studies. Cultural and Personal themes have the least diverse factor sets. Within Cultural studies, personal and perceptive factors dominate, indicating that cultural influences shape individual perceptions (opinions) and values (personal factors). In personal studies, social factors are overshadowed by others, suggesting that individual preferences take precedence over group opinions. Most studies on individual differences do not consider societal influences, signaling an unexplored area for future research. Although no significant relationship exists between factors and themes, it is still useful to look at some patterns.\nOk, I’m not interested in seeing if there are differences in how many times factors appear significant and non-significant across themes. First, let’s merge the long data on factor and non-significant factors with factor_scores datasets. The factor scores were the counts of how many times each factor appeared across the literature as significant/non-significant.\n\nlonglong_fac &lt;- df %&gt;% pivot_longer(\n    cols = F1:F9,\n    names_to = \"NAMES\",\n    values_to = \"FAC_NS\"\n) %&gt;% filter(FAC_NS != \"\" & FAC_NS != \" \" & FAC_NS != \"external\")\n\nlonglong_nonsigfac &lt;- df %&gt;% pivot_longer(\n    cols = FNS1:FNS4,\n    names_to = \"NAMES\",\n    values_to = \"FAC_NS\"\n) %&gt;% filter(FAC_NS != \"\" & FAC_NS != \" \" & FAC_NS != \"external\") \n\ndf_merged_fac &lt;- longlong_fac %&gt;% left_join(factor_scores, by = \"FAC_NS\")\ndf_merged_nonsigfac &lt;- longlong_nonsigfac %&gt;% left_join(factor_scores, by = \"FAC_NS\")\n\nThe significance score across themes:\n\nggplot(df_merged_fac, \n    aes(x = DecisionTheme, y = Score_Sig, \n        fill = DecisionTheme)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Theme\",\n       y = \"Factor's Significance Score\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1,\n   face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost themes have a high median significant score. The median for all themes is close to 1.0, meaning most factors are frequently significant, at least relative to their total occurrences. Variation exists, but it’s minor. Some themes (e.g., market, cultural and demographic) have slightly lower median than others. The IQR is small, indicating that most factor scores are clustered near the top. Some data points fall below 0.5, suggesting a few factors appear non-significant more so than they are significant. These outliers might indicate less relevant factors for certain themes. Since most medians are high and IQR’s are similar, no theme strongly dominates in terms of factor scores. Market studies might have slightly lower scores than others, indicating device and technology specific factors may be needed. I can also find out which factors have a low significance score for each theme:\n\nhead(df_merged_fac %&gt;% filter(Score_Sig &lt;= 0.5) %&gt;% dplyr::select(FAC_NS, DecisionTheme))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  FAC_NS  DecisionTheme\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        \n1 age     psychological\n2 soc_val demographic  \n3 edu     market       \n4 trial   social       \n5 age     demographic  \n6 edu     demographic  \n\n\nThe outliers (Score_Sig \\leq 0.5) and the related theme they appeared as an outlier in are: Age (Psychological), Education (Market), Triability (Social), Hedonic and Social Value (Perceptive), and Age, Education and Social Value (Demographic). The reason for these outliers are:\n\nthese factors either do not appear frequently in those themes, or\nthey do appear, but they are not frequently found to be significant.\n\nFor example, I expected age and education to appear in many Demographic studies. Therefore, it is surprising that these factors have low scores. This indicates that age and education are either not frequently used in Demographic studies or they are frequently found to be non-significant variables in m-banking adoption.\nThe non-significance score across themes:\n\nggplot(df_merged_nonsigfac,\n    aes(x = DecisionTheme, y = Score_NOT_Sig, \n        fill = DecisionTheme)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Theme\",\n       y = \"Factor's Non Significance Score\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, \n  face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerceptive has the widest range of non-significant scores, with a high median (around 0.75). Demographic also has a relatively high median, meaning many factors in demographic-related studies were found to be non-significant. Some themes (e.g., Perceptive and Demographic) show high variability in non-significant factor scores, while some report very low variability. The presence of outliers suggests that certain studies had unusually high numbers of non-significant factors. The outliers are factors with non-significant scores of higher than 0.5 (appearing more than half of their total frequency as non-significant).\n\nhead(df_merged_nonsigfac %&gt;% filter(Score_NOT_Sig &gt; 0.5) %&gt;% dplyr::select(FAC_NS, DecisionTheme))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  FAC_NS   DecisionTheme\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;        \n1 soc_val  demographic  \n2 cond_val demographic  \n3 trial    demographic  \n4 soc_val  demographic  \n5 pu_atm   perceptive   \n6 soc_val  psychological\n\n\nThese are: Social Value, Conditional Value, Triability (Demographic), Perceived Usefulness of ATM devices, Search Convenience and Evaluation Convenience (Perceptive), Social Value and Hedonic Experience (Psychological), Triability (Personal) and Convenience barriers (Market).\nAn interesting observation is social values being an outlier in demographic studies for both significance and non-significane score.\n\nglimpse(df %&gt;% filter(F1 == \"soc_val\" | F2 == \"soc_val\" | F3 == \"soc_val\" | F4 == \"soc_val\" | F5 == \"soc_val\" | F6 == \"soc_val\" | F7 == \"soc_val\" | F8 == \"soc_val\" | F9 == \"soc_val\"))\n\nRows: 2\nColumns: 63\n$ Reason_Theme       &lt;chr&gt; \"In agreement\", \"\"\n$ CiteKey            &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ ID                 &lt;chr&gt; \"p2_37\", \"p2_143\"\n$ Algo_Theme         &lt;chr&gt; \"psychological, market, perceptive\", \"perceptive, p…\n$ DecisionTheme      &lt;chr&gt; \"demographic\", \"perceptive\"\n$ Man_Theme          &lt;chr&gt; \"personal, demographic\", \"perceptive\"\n$ Match              &lt;int&gt; 0, 1\n$ Title              &lt;chr&gt; \"consumption values and mobile banking services: un…\n$ Year               &lt;int&gt; 2021, 2024\n$ PublicationTitle   &lt;chr&gt; \"international journal of bank marketing\", \"spanish…\n$ Creators           &lt;chr&gt; \"heikki karjaluoto, richard glavee-geo, dineshwar r…\n$ Publisher          &lt;chr&gt; \"emerald\", \"emerald\"\n$ AffiliationCountry &lt;chr&gt; \"mauritius\", \"spain, macedonia\"\n$ K1                 &lt;chr&gt; \"technology acceptance model\", \"perceived value\"\n$ K2                 &lt;chr&gt; \"perceived value\", \"mobile\"\n$ K3                 &lt;chr&gt; \"discriminant validity\", \"services\"\n$ K4                 &lt;chr&gt; \"behavioral intention\", \"adoption\"\n$ K5                 &lt;chr&gt; \"initial trust\", \"acceptance\"\n$ K6                 &lt;chr&gt; \"social value\", \"commerce\"\n$ K7                 &lt;chr&gt; \"method bias\", \"drives\"\n$ K8                 &lt;chr&gt; \"adoption\", NA\n$ K9                 &lt;chr&gt; \"recommendations\", NA\n$ K10                &lt;chr&gt; \"identification\", NA\n$ Num_Factors        &lt;int&gt; 4, 5\n$ F1                 &lt;chr&gt; \"fun_val\", \"util_val\"\n$ F2                 &lt;chr&gt; \"epi_val\", \"hed_val\"\n$ F3                 &lt;chr&gt; \"emo_val\", \"soc_val\"\n$ F4                 &lt;chr&gt; \"soc_val\", \"epi_val\"\n$ F5                 &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"pval\"\n$ F6                 &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ F7                 &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ F8                 &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ F9                 &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ F1_THEME           &lt;chr&gt; \"personal\", \"personal\"\n$ F2_THEME           &lt;chr&gt; \"personal\", \"personal\"\n$ F3_THEME           &lt;chr&gt; \"psychological\", \"social\"\n$ F4_THEME           &lt;chr&gt; \"social\", \"personal\"\n$ F5_THEME           &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"perceptive\"\n$ F6_THEME           &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ F7_THEME           &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ F8_THEME           &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ F9_THEME           &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ NUM_FAC_NOTSIG     &lt;int&gt; 1, 1\n$ FNS1               &lt;chr&gt; \"soc_val\", \"hed_val\"\n$ FNS2               &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ FNS3               &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ FNS4               &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ ResearchType       &lt;chr&gt; \"quantitative\", \"quantitative\"\n$ SampleSize         &lt;int&gt; 246, 252\n$ METHOD1            &lt;chr&gt; \"pls sem\", \"pls sem\"\n$ METHOD2            &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ METHOD3            &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ METHOD4            &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ Tech               &lt;chr&gt; \"mobile banking\", \"mobile banking\"\n$ THEORY1            &lt;chr&gt; \"tcv\", \"sor\"\n$ THEORY2            &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"tcv\"\n$ THEORY3            &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ THEORY4            &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ LIMIT1             &lt;chr&gt; \"sample_size\", \"loc_specific\"\n$ LIMIT2             &lt;chr&gt; \"loc_specific\", \"\"\n$ LIMIT3             &lt;chr&gt; \"\", \"\"\n$ Abstract           &lt;chr&gt; \"purpose this study develops a theoretical model of…\n$ SampleSizeBin      &lt;chr&gt; \"SQ1\", \"SQ1\"\n\n\nThis is because of the study of Karjaluoto @karjaluotoConsumptionValuesMobile2021b where they found that social values did not influence trust in m-banking directly. However, social value is a significant moderator between functional value and intention to m-bank. Other insights from this analysis are: Perceptive studies may either not be reliable or may be useful to frameworks to assess the significance of factors in. Since another reason for low scores of factors are due to them not appearing as frequently across the literature, we also highlight several of these overlooked factors across themes. Identifying these gaps can provide valuable insights for future research and broaden the understanding of m-banking adoption.\nI can test whether certain themes are more likely to have non-significant factors:\n\nkruskal.test(Score_NOT_Sig ~ DecisionTheme, data = df_merged_nonsigfac)\n\n\n    Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test\n\ndata:  Score_NOT_Sig by DecisionTheme\nKruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 15.829, df = 6, p-value = 0.0147\n\n\nIf p &lt; 0.05, it confirms that certain themes are more likely to have non-significant factors.\nI can also identify which specific factors within perceptive or demographic themes are most non-significant. Check interaction effects (e.g., Does the study’s research method influence significance?).\n\nlonglongfactors &lt;- df %&gt;% pivot_longer(\n    cols = F1:F9,\n    names_to = \"NAMES\",\n    values_to = \"FAC\"\n) %&gt;% filter(FAC != \"\" & FAC != \" \")\n\nprint(\"Unique Decision Themes: \\n\") \n\n[1] \"Unique Decision Themes: \\n\"\n\nunique(df$DecisionTheme)\n\n[1] \"cultural\"      \"psychological\" \"demographic\"   \"perceptive\"   \n[5] \"social\"        \"market\"        \"personal\"     \n\n\n\nhead(longlongfactors %&gt;% \n    group_by(DecisionTheme) %&gt;%\n    count(FAC) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% \n    filter(DecisionTheme == \"personal\"))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   DecisionTheme [1]\n  DecisionTheme FAC           n\n  &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 personal      peou          4\n2 personal      pu            4\n3 personal      efex          3\n4 personal      habt          3\n5 personal      hed_motiv     3\n6 personal      peex          3\n\n\nIn the paper, I actually wanted to find the factors that appeared the least number of times. So, just take out the desc() arrangement and then look for the papers that have used certain factors (only once). For example, agreeableness was used only once. Let’s see which personal-themed paper used it:\n\ndf %&gt;% pivot_longer(\n    cols = F1:F9,\n    names_to = \"NAMES\",\n    values_to = \"THINGS\") %&gt;%\n    filter(DecisionTheme == \"personal\" &\n           THINGS == \"agrbns\") %&gt;%\n    dplyr::select(ID)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  ID    \n  &lt;chr&gt; \n1 p2_106\n\n\nThis was then referenced in the paper I wrote.\nThe same entire process was repeated for Theory, Methods, Limitations, Factors and Non-significant Factors.\n\n\n\nFoundational Theories\n\ncounts_dflong &lt;- theory_long %&gt;% \n        filter(THEORY != \"\" & THEORY != \" \"\n            & !is.na(THEORY)) %&gt;% \n        count(THEORY) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n))\n    \ncounts_df_long &lt;- data.frame(\n    Group = rep(counts_dflong$THEORY, times = counts_dflong$n),\n    Value = unlist(lapply(counts_dflong$n, function(x) seq_len(x))))\n    \nanova_result &lt;- aov(Value ~ Group, data = counts_df_long)\nsummary(anova_result)\n\n             Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&gt;F)    \nGroup        42  18420   438.6   3.632 1.82e-08 ***\nResiduals   120  14492   120.8                     \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\nGreat, There’s statistically significant differences in the distribution of Theories in the data.

This doesn’t help much, so I’ll set aside the top methods and the top theories:\n\nlonglongGroup2 &lt;- longlong_theorymethod %&gt;% \n    group_by(THINGS) %&gt;% filter(\n        THINGS != \"SEM\" & THINGS != \"PLS SEM\" & THINGS != \"PLS\"& \n        THEORY != \"TAM\" & THEORY != \"UTAUT\"\n    ) %&gt;% count(THEORY) %&gt;% arrange(desc(n)) \n\nggplot(longlongGroup2, \n       aes(area = n, fill = as.factor(THINGS),\n           label = paste(THEORY, THINGS, sep = \"\\n\"))) +\n  geom_treemap() +\n  geom_treemap_text(\n    aes(color = \"black\"), \n    place = \"centre\",\n    reflow = TRUE,\n    min.size = 0\n  ) +\n  #scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"rocket\") + \n  scale_color_identity() +  \n  labs(fill = \"THEORY\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\", \n    legend.text = element_text(size = 7), \n    legend.spacing.y = unit(0.1, \"cm\"),   \n    legend.key.height = unit(0.2, \"cm\"),  \n  ) + guides(color = guide_legend(ncol = 7)) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch more useful information from this. For example, we see that newer model theories like Elaborate Likelihood Method (ELM) incorporate moderation and mediation analysis. Whereas older models like TAM, DOI, TPB were the ones using confirmatory factor analysis and SEM.\n\n\nTheory vs Limits\nFor limits, I’m setting aside the least referenced (ttest) and the limit in scope that is captured in other limits.

Well, I decided they’re both equally as important, so I come up with a score for each topic number that’s just the weighted average of coherence and perplexity.

    "title": "Effect Of Mental Health on Mobile Banking",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this project, I focused on analyzing how mental health relates to mobile banking adoption. I used data from the Canadian Internet Use Survey, which includes questions about digital habits, mental health, and demographics. You can find the dataset here. I built a fixed-effects logistic regression model, grouped by province, to control for regional differences as this was the sampling cluster. My main variable was self-reported mental health scores. I included factors like relationship satisfaction, smartphone dependency, and social media use. I also tested interaction effects to see if these variables change the way mental health influences mobile banking use. The following is a step-by-step on the coding and analysis of the project.\n\n\nNote that not all libraries may be utilized. The most important ones are dplyr, lme4, tidyr, ggplot2, psych, corrr, haven, marginaleffects and margins and any related libraries to these.\n\nlibrary(corrr)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(lavaan)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(rempsyc)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(report)\nlibrary(effectsize)\nlibrary(aod)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ROCR)\nlibrary(jtools)\nlibrary(xtable)\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(nlme)\nlibrary(weights)\nlibrary(miscTools)\nlibrary(systemfit)\nlibrary(multcomp)\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(GGally)\nrequire(reshape2)\nrequire(lattice)\nlibrary(HLMdiag)\nlibrary(margins)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\nlibrary(effects)\nlibrary(margins)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(plm)\nlibrary(effectsize)\nlibrary(aod)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(foreign)\nlibrary(AER)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(formatR)\nlibrary(pglm)\nlibrary(acqr)\n\n\n\n\nI first started by reading the entire PUMF file available.\nThis gives you information on how the survey was set up, why, and how things were measured. Then, I looked at the individual survey questions to see the available data, and how they were measured. In general, questions are measured numerically were answeres follow as such:\n\nYes : 1, No : 2, Valid Skip: 6, Don’t Know: 7, Refusal: 8, Not Stated: 9\n\nOf course this differs question-by-question as some questions have other answer categories and some questions (which were note used in my study) asked for numerical input from the participants (like how much did you spend online last year). To help readers understand the data, I will include the question exactly as it appears in the CIUS 2020 PUMF Data Dictionary with corresponding answer choices and codes. These will be in a blue-bordered box, and will include the Variable name (on the PUMF file), Concept, Question Body and Answers. Then I will show you in R code how I’ve re-coded and used the question as a model variable. The Variables I need are as follows:\n\nMobile banking adoption (mBanking)\nAge Group (AGE)\nSmartphone Dependent (SD)\nIncome Quintile (INC)\nFriendship Satisfaction (FRISAT)\nMental Health (MH)\nFamily Relation Satisfaction (FAMSAT)\nEducation Level (EDU)\nImmigration Status (IMM)\nEmployment Status (EMP)\nFamily Type (FAM)\nGender (SEX)\nSocial Media Use (SNS)\nProvince (province)\n\nThe data is available in various formats. To avoid data loss, I decided to use the .dta format (SAS file). You need the haven package to read SAS files. However, this file is 150MB in size and since I am uploading the code in my GitHub repository, I am not able to use the SAS file. So I’ve saved the data in a .csv file with only the columns I will need. This is how you’d read a SAS file:\n\nds20 &lt;- read_dta(\"data/cius2020_2022nov18_en.dta\")\nds &lt;- ds20\n\nInstead, I run this:\n\nds10 &lt;- read.csv(\"ds.csv\")\nds &lt;- ds10 \n\nStep 1. Smartphone Users Select only those who use smartphones because the question is about “online banking” and not “mobile banking”.\n\n\n\nVariable Name: DV_010A\n\nConcept: Devices used\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nDuring the past three months, what devices did you use to access the Internet?\nDid you use:\nA smartphone\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nYes\n1\n\n\nNo\n2\n\n\nValid Skip\n6\n\n\nDon’t Know\n7\n\n\nRefusal\n8\n\n\nNot Stated\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% \n    mutate(\n        devSM = case_when(\n            dv_010a == 1 ~ 1, #yes\n            dv_010a == 2 ~ 0, #no\n        .default = -1, #any valid skip and not stated \n        )\n    )\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% \n   filter(devSM == 1)\n\nStep 2. Mobile Banking Question Select the outcome variable, mobile banking:\n\n\n\nVariable Name: UI_050D\n\nConcept: Activities related to other online activities\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nDuring the past three months, which of the following other online activities, have you done over the Internet? Have you: Conducted online banking\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nYes\n1\n\n\nNo\n2\n\n\nValid Skip\n6\n\n\nDon’t Know\n7\n\n\nRefusal\n8\n\n\nNot Stated\n9\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Select Other Model Variables Now I will move on to selecting the predictors. For Smartphone Dependency:\n\n\n\nVariable Name: SM_030A\n\nConcept: Frequency of use of smartphone\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nIn a typical day, how often do you check your smartphone?\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nAt least every 5 minutes\n01\n\n\nAt least every 15 minutes\n02\n\n\nAt least every 30 minutes\n03\n\n\nOne time per hour\n04\n\n\nOnce a day or a few times per day\n05\n\n\nLess than one time per day\n06\n\n\nValid skip\n96\n\n\nDon’t know\n97\n\n\nRefusal\n98\n\n\nNot stated\n99\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this one is no longer just a yes/no question, but has a few categories for answers. Since I’m thinking of tracking “dependence”, it makes sense that the more frequent checking gets a higher value. So, this is how I code this variable:\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        #timeline : past 3 months \n        mBanking = case_when(\n            ui_050d == 1 ~ 1, # Yes \n            ui_050d == 2 ~ 0, # No \n            .default = -1 # valid skip, don't know, refused, not stated \n        ),\n        \n        SD = case_when(\n            sm_030a == 1 ~ 6, # At least every 5 minutes \n            sm_030a == 2 ~ 5, # At least every 15 minutes \n            sm_030a == 3 ~ 4, # At least every 30 minutes  \n            sm_030a == 4 ~ 3, # One time per hour  \n            sm_030a == 5 ~ 2, # Once a day or a few times per day  \n            sm_030a == 6 ~ 1, # Less than one time per day\n            .default = 96 # Valid skip 96 , Don’t know 97 , Refusal  98, Not stated  99\n        )\n    )\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(SD &lt; 10)\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(mBanking != -1) \n\nThe filters are just making sure that the skip’s, don’t know’s, refusal’s and not stated answers are dropped. This is not too big of a loss. There are 17,409 rows of data.\nFriendship Satisfaction:\n\n\n\nVariable Name: TS_010A\n\nConcept: Satisfaction with relationships\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nIn general, on a scale from 1 to 5 where 1 means «completely dissatisfied» and 5 means «completely satisfied», how satisfied are you with the relationships you have with the following people?

Gather Demographic and Other Information Here, I will select some demographic information. Since these are not direct questions but information retrieved from other sources (such as postal codes for province), some of them do not have Skips/Don’t Know/Refusal/Not Stated answers. If they have, I have added those to the cards. I have also added a frequency column for these variables only to show you the demographic distribution of the sample (not weighted).\n\n\n\nVariable Name: PROVINCE\n\nConcept: PROVINCE\n\n\nNote:\nInformation derived using postal codes.\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador\n10\n950\n\n\nPrince Edward Island\n11\n1,154\n\n\nNova Scotia\n12\n1,181\n\n\nNew Brunswick\n13\n1,223\n\n\nQuebec\n24\n3,911\n\n\nOntario\n35\n3,719\n\n\nManitoba\n46\n973\n\n\nSaskatchewan\n47\n979\n\n\nAlberta\n48\n1,365\n\n\nBritish Columbia\n59\n1,954\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: AGE_GRP\n\nConcept: Age Groups – Derived variable\n\n\nNote:\nDerived from age of persons in the household\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n15 to 24 years\n01\n828\n\n\n25 to 34 years\n02\n1,805\n\n\n35 to 44 years\n03\n2,520\n\n\n45 to 54 years\n04\n2,469\n\n\n55 to 64 years\n05\n3,889\n\n\n65 years and over\n06\n5,898\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: GENDER\n\nConcept: Gender - Derived variable\n\n\nNote:\nRefers to current gender which may be different from sex assigned at birth and may be different from what is indicated on legal documents.

This intuitively makes sense. Adding more nuance to this graph, I can see how this relationship changes for people who adopted m-banking and those that didn’t. It seems the two relationships are almost identical, at least in direction.\n\nggplot(data    = ds,\n       aes(x   = MH,\n           y   = SD,\n           col = as.factor(mBanking)))+ #to add the colours for different classes\n    geom_point(size     = 1.2,\n             alpha    = .8,\n             position = \"jitter\")+ \n    #scale_color_manual(name = \"MBanking\",\n                     #labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"),\n                     #values = c(\"red\", \"lightblue\")) + #+ ggnewscale::new_scale_color() +\n    geom_smooth(method   = lm,\n              se       = T, \n              size     = 1.5, \n              linetype = 1, \n              alpha    = .7,\n              ) + \n    scale_color_manual(name = \"MBanking\",\n                     labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"),\n                     values = c(\"black\", \"darkred\")) + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same type of visualizations can be helpful for other factors in the model. Now, I will separate the data into those that have adopted m-banking and those that haven’t. Let’s look at the differences in familial relationship satisfaction for these two groups across mental health. For m-banking adopters, it seems that those with better mental health (3 or higher) are completely satisfied with their family relationships (blue bar). On the other hand, those that haven’t adopted m-banking are either less satisfied or completely unsatisfied (MH = 5, mBanking = 0 group’s largest bar is red, which is FAMSAT = 1, the lowest score).\n\nds1 &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 1)\nds2 &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 0)\n\ngg5 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds1, aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(FAMSAT)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"FAMSAT\")\n\ngg6 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds2 %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 0), aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(FAMSAT)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"FAMSAT\")\n\nggarrange(gg5, gg6, ncol = 2, labels = c(\"mBanking = 1\", \"mBanking = 0\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s important to mention that visualizations don’t actually tell us the real story. Especially when working with large datasets with more than 10,000 data points. This is simply a somewhat visible pattern that tells me it’s worth looking into when I do my statistical analysis. We do the same type of visualization, now measuring social media use. Surprisingly, social media use goes up with better mental health scores for adopters but decreases for non-adopters.\n\ngg7 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds1, aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(SNS)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"SNS\")\n\ngg8 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds2 %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 0), aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(SNS)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"SNS\")\n\nggarrange(gg7, gg8, ncol = 2, labels = c(\"mBanking = 1\", \"mBanking = 0\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we do the same with smartphone dependency. It seems that non-adopters are actually more dependent on their smartphones and also (with better mental health).\n\ngg9 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds1, aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(SD)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"SD\")\n\ngg10 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds2 %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 0), aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(SD)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"SD\")\n\nggarrange(gg9, gg10, ncol = 2, labels = c(\"mBanking = 1\", \"mBanking = 0\"))",

    "text": "In this chapter, I look into how mental health might affect whether people choose to adopt mobile banking or not. While doing my review of past studies (refer to study 1 ), I noticed that a lot of research talks about how things like trust, risk, and perceived ease of use affect adoption. But very few studies look at how a person’s mental and emotional state influences their behavior. Especially because some studies actively showed how not accounting for people’s emotions were sometiems giving them strange results.\nI also found that even if the literature did talk about emotions, it was mostly about emotions as a result of the adoption/use of a technology. Not about how your general mood or feelings or struggles impact how you behave and interact with technology. Like I know when I’m stressed out or dreading something, the doom scrolling gets worse! But social media apps are built to be addictive and drag you in and make you want it more. Until you actually stop enjoying it and being online is no longer fun. In fact, I read just recently how engagement and use of social media apps has dropped in recent years! I’ll find the citation for it later! Anyway, I digress… Point is, I think your mood definitely affects how you interact with the world and technology is part of that world. So, what about people who have special moods? That is, certain behavioral or mental challenges? Not exactly disabilities, but hidden challenges often ignored!\nI wanted to explore whether people who are feeling mentally well are more or less likely to use mobile banking. My guess going in was that people with better mental health might feel more confident and more open to using this tech. But I found out it was actually the opposite! Then I got to thinking… why is that? Well, Here’s my guess:\n\nMaybe people with poorer mental health actually rely on mobile banking to avoid going out and talking to people, or dealing with stress in traditional banking.\nMaybe people who are happy don’t bank and don’t stress about money!\nIt’s not a causation, and I don’t know which comes first - are people who bank less happier or is it that happy people don’t bank as often? This is not the study to answer that. But that would be a cool study!\n\nI used Canadian survey data and looked at three things related to mental health:\n\nHow satisfied are you in your relationships (RS)\nHow dependent are you on your smartphones (SD)\nWhether or not you use social media (SNS)\n\nI also tested whether these three things change (or “moderate”) how mental health affects mobile banking adoption. This chapter is where I introduce mental health as a new factor in mobile banking adoption models. I show how mental and emotional states might be just as important as the usual stuff like trust or app features. The results surprised me, and hopefully, they’ll give banks and researchers something new to think about too.\nBy the way, this chapter was already published in .",

    "text": "In this chapter, I look into how mental health might affect whether people choose to adopt mobile banking or not. While doing my review of past studies (refer to study 1 ), I noticed that a lot of research talks about how things like trust, risk, and perceived ease of use affect adoption. But very few studies look at how a person’s mental and emotional state influences their behavior. Especially because some studies actively showed how not accounting for people’s emotions were sometiems giving them strange results.\nI also found that even if the literature did talk about emotions, it was mostly about emotions as a result of the adoption/use of a technology. Not about how your general mood or feelings or struggles impact how you behave and interact with technology. Like I know when I’m stressed out or dreading something, the doom scrolling gets worse! But social media apps are built to be addictive and drag you in and make you want it more. Until you actually stop enjoying it and being online is no longer fun. In fact, I read just recently how engagement and use of social media apps has dropped in recent years! I’ll find the citation for it later! Anyway, I digress… Point is, I think your mood definitely affects how you interact with the world and technology is part of that world. So, what about people who have special moods? That is, certain behavioral or mental challenges? Not exactly disabilities, but hidden challenges often ignored!\nI wanted to explore whether people who are feeling mentally well are more or less likely to use mobile banking. My guess going in was that people with better mental health might feel more confident and more open to using this tech. But I found out it was actually the opposite! Then I got to thinking… why is that? Well, Here’s my guess:\n\nMaybe people with poorer mental health actually rely on mobile banking to avoid going out and talking to people, or dealing with stress in traditional banking.\nMaybe people who are happy don’t bank and don’t stress about money!\nIt’s not a causation, and I don’t know which comes first - are people who bank less happier or is it that happy people don’t bank as often? This is not the study to answer that. But that would be a cool study!\n\nI used Canadian survey data and looked at three things related to mental health:\n\nHow satisfied are you in your relationships (RS)\nHow dependent are you on your smartphones (SD)\nWhether or not you use social media (SNS)\n\nI also tested whether these three things change (or “moderate”) how mental health affects mobile banking adoption. This chapter is where I introduce mental health as a new factor in mobile banking adoption models. I show how mental and emotional states might be just as important as the usual stuff like trust or app features. The results surprised me, and hopefully, they’ll give banks and researchers something new to think about too.\nBy the way, this chapter was already published in .",

    "title": "Effect Of Mental Health on Mobile Banking",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this project, I focused on analyzing how mental health relates to mobile banking adoption. I used data from the Canadian Internet Use Survey, which includes questions about digital habits, mental health, and demographics. You can find the dataset . I built a fixed-effects logistic regression model, grouped by province, to control for regional differences as this was the sampling cluster. My main variable was self-reported mental health scores. I included factors like relationship satisfaction, smartphone dependency, and social media use. I also tested interaction effects to see if these variables change the way mental health influences mobile banking use. The following is a step-by-step on the coding and analysis of the project.\n\n\nNote that not all libraries may be utilized. The most important ones are dplyr, lme4, tidyr, ggplot2, psych, corrr, haven, marginaleffects and margins and any related libraries to these.\n\n\n\nI first started by reading the entire PUMF file available.\nThis gives you information on how the survey was set up, why, and how things were measured. Then, I looked at the individual survey questions to see the available data, and how they were measured. In general, questions are measured numerically were answeres follow as such: &gt; Yes : 1, No : 2, Valid Skip: 6, Don’t Know: 7, Refusal: 8, Not Stated: 9 Of course this differs question-by-question as some questions have other answer categories and some questions (which were note used in my study) asked for numerical input from the participants (like how much did you spend online last year). To help readers understand the data, I will include the question exactly as it appears in the CIUS 2020 PUMF Data Dictionary with corresponding answer choices and codes. These will be in a blue-bordered box, and will include the Variable name (on the PUMF file), Concept, Question Body and Answers. Then I will show you in R code how I’ve re-coded and used the question as a model variable. The Variables I need are as follows:\n\nMobile banking adoption (mBanking)\nAge Group (AGE)\nSmartphone Dependent (SD)\nIncome Quintile (INC)\nFriendship Satisfaction (FRISAT)\nMental Health (MH)\nFamily Relation Satisfaction (FAMSAT)\nEducation Level (EDU)\nImmigration Status (IMM)\nEmployment Status (EMP)\nFamily Type (FAM)\nGender (SEX)\nSocial Media Use (SNS)\nProvince (province)\n\nThe data is available in various formats. To avoid data loss, I decided to use the .dta format (SAS file). You need the haven package to read SAS files. However, this file is 150MB in size and since I am uploading the code in my GitHub repository, I am not able to use the SAS file. So I’ve saved the data in a .csv file with only the columns I will need. This is how you’d read a SAS file:\n\nds20 &lt;- read_dta(\"data/cius2020_2022nov18_en.dta\")\nds &lt;- ds20\n\nInstead, I run this:\n\nds10 &lt;- read.csv(\"ds.csv\")\nds &lt;- ds10 \n\nStep 1. Smartphone Users Select only those who use smartphones because the question is about “online banking” and not “mobile banking”.\n\n\n\nVariable Name: DV_010A\n\nConcept: Devices used\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nDuring the past three months, what devices did you use to access the Internet?\nDid you use:\nA smartphone\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nYes\n1\n\n\nNo\n2\n\n\nValid Skip\n6\n\n\nDon’t Know\n7\n\n\nRefusal\n8\n\n\nNot Stated\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% \n    mutate(\n        devSM = case_when(\n            dv_010a == 1 ~ 1, #yes\n            dv_010a == 2 ~ 0, #no\n        .default = -1, #any valid skip and not stated \n        )\n    )\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% \n   filter(devSM == 1)\n\nStep 2. Mobile Banking Question Select the outcome variable, mobile banking:\n\n\n\nVariable Name: UI_050D\n\nConcept: Activities related to other online activities\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nDuring the past three months, which of the following other online activities, have you done over the Internet? Have you: Conducted online banking\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nYes\n1\n\n\nNo\n2\n\n\nValid Skip\n6\n\n\nDon’t Know\n7\n\n\nRefusal\n8\n\n\nNot Stated\n9\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Select Other Model Variables Now I will move on to selecting the predictors. For Smartphone Dependency:\n\n\n\nVariable Name: SM_030A\n\nConcept: Frequency of use of smartphone\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nIn a typical day, how often do you check your smartphone?\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nAt least every 5 minutes\n01\n\n\nAt least every 15 minutes\n02\n\n\nAt least every 30 minutes\n03\n\n\nOne time per hour\n04\n\n\nOnce a day or a few times per day\n05\n\n\nLess than one time per day\n06\n\n\nValid skip\n96\n\n\nDon’t know\n97\n\n\nRefusal\n98\n\n\nNot stated\n99\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this one is no longer just a yes/no question, but has a few categories for answers. Since I’m thinking of tracking “dependence”, it makes sense that the more frequent checking gets a higher value. So, this is how I code this variable:\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        #timeline : past 3 months \n        mBanking = case_when(\n            ui_050d == 1 ~ 1, # Yes \n            ui_050d == 2 ~ 0, # No \n            .default = -1 # valid skip, don't know, refused, not stated \n        ),\n        \n        SD = case_when(\n            sm_030a == 1 ~ 6, # At least every 5 minutes \n            sm_030a == 2 ~ 5, # At least every 15 minutes \n            sm_030a == 3 ~ 4, # At least every 30 minutes  \n            sm_030a == 4 ~ 3, # One time per hour  \n            sm_030a == 5 ~ 2, # Once a day or a few times per day  \n            sm_030a == 6 ~ 1, # Less than one time per day\n            .default = 96 # Valid skip 96 , Don’t know 97 , Refusal  98, Not stated  99\n        )\n    )\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(SD &lt; 10)\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(mBanking != -1) \n\nThe filters are just making sure that the skip’s, don’t know’s, refusal’s and not stated answers are dropped.

    "text": "In this project, I focused on analyzing how mental health relates to mobile banking adoption. I used data from the Canadian Internet Use Survey, which includes questions about digital habits, mental health, and demographics. You can find the dataset here. I built a fixed-effects logistic regression model, grouped by province, to control for regional differences as this was the sampling cluster. My main variable was self-reported mental health scores. I included factors like relationship satisfaction, smartphone dependency, and social media use. I also tested interaction effects to see if these variables change the way mental health influences mobile banking use. The following is a step-by-step on the coding and analysis of the project.\n\n\nNote that not all libraries may be utilized. The most important ones are dplyr, lme4, tidyr, ggplot2, psych, corrr, haven, marginaleffects and margins and any related libraries to these.\n\nlibrary(corrr)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(lavaan)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(rempsyc)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(report)\nlibrary(effectsize)\nlibrary(aod)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ROCR)\nlibrary(jtools)\nlibrary(xtable)\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(nlme)\nlibrary(weights)\nlibrary(miscTools)\nlibrary(systemfit)\nlibrary(multcomp)\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(GGally)\nrequire(reshape2)\nrequire(lattice)\nlibrary(HLMdiag)\nlibrary(margins)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\nlibrary(effects)\nlibrary(margins)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(plm)\nlibrary(effectsize)\nlibrary(aod)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(foreign)\nlibrary(AER)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(formatR)\nlibrary(pglm)\nlibrary(acqr)\n\n\n\n\nI first started by reading the entire PUMF file available.\nThis gives you information on how the survey was set up, why, and how things were measured. Then, I looked at the individual survey questions to see the available data, and how they were measured. In general, questions are measured numerically were answeres follow as such:\n\nYes : 1, No : 2, Valid Skip: 6, Don’t Know: 7, Refusal: 8, Not Stated: 9\n\nOf course this differs question-by-question as some questions have other answer categories and some questions (which were note used in my study) asked for numerical input from the participants (like how much did you spend online last year). To help readers understand the data, I will include the question exactly as it appears in the CIUS 2020 PUMF Data Dictionary with corresponding answer choices and codes. These will be in a blue-bordered box, and will include the Variable name (on the PUMF file), Concept, Question Body and Answers. Then I will show you in R code how I’ve re-coded and used the question as a model variable. The Variables I need are as follows:\n\nMobile banking adoption (mBanking)\nAge Group (AGE)\nSmartphone Dependent (SD)\nIncome Quintile (INC)\nFriendship Satisfaction (FRISAT)\nMental Health (MH)\nFamily Relation Satisfaction (FAMSAT)\nEducation Level (EDU)\nImmigration Status (IMM)\nEmployment Status (EMP)\nFamily Type (FAM)\nGender (SEX)\nSocial Media Use (SNS)\nProvince (province)\n\nThe data is available in various formats. To avoid data loss, I decided to use the .dta format (SAS file). You need the haven package to read SAS files. However, this file is 150MB in size and since I am uploading the code in my GitHub repository, I am not able to use the SAS file. So I’ve saved the data in a .csv file with only the columns I will need. This is how you’d read a SAS file:\n\nds20 &lt;- read_dta(\"data/cius2020_2022nov18_en.dta\")\nds &lt;- ds20\n\nInstead, I run this:\n\nds10 &lt;- read.csv(\"ds.csv\")\nds &lt;- ds10 \n\nStep 1. Smartphone Users Select only those who use smartphones because the question is about “online banking” and not “mobile banking”.\n\n\n\nVariable Name: DV_010A\n\nConcept: Devices used\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nDuring the past three months, what devices did you use to access the Internet?\nDid you use:\nA smartphone\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nYes\n1\n\n\nNo\n2\n\n\nValid Skip\n6\n\n\nDon’t Know\n7\n\n\nRefusal\n8\n\n\nNot Stated\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% \n    mutate(\n        devSM = case_when(\n            dv_010a == 1 ~ 1, #yes\n            dv_010a == 2 ~ 0, #no\n        .default = -1, #any valid skip and not stated \n        )\n    )\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% \n   filter(devSM == 1)\n\nStep 2. Mobile Banking Question Select the outcome variable, mobile banking:\n\n\n\nVariable Name: UI_050D\n\nConcept: Activities related to other online activities\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nDuring the past three months, which of the following other online activities, have you done over the Internet? Have you: Conducted online banking\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nYes\n1\n\n\nNo\n2\n\n\nValid Skip\n6\n\n\nDon’t Know\n7\n\n\nRefusal\n8\n\n\nNot Stated\n9\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Select Other Model Variables Now I will move on to selecting the predictors. For Smartphone Dependency:\n\n\n\nVariable Name: SM_030A\n\nConcept: Frequency of use of smartphone\n\n\nQuestion Text:\nIn a typical day, how often do you check your smartphone?\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nAt least every 5 minutes\n01\n\n\nAt least every 15 minutes\n02\n\n\nAt least every 30 minutes\n03\n\n\nOne time per hour\n04\n\n\nOnce a day or a few times per day\n05\n\n\nLess than one time per day\n06\n\n\nValid skip\n96\n\n\nDon’t know\n97\n\n\nRefusal\n98\n\n\nNot stated\n99\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this one is no longer just a yes/no question, but has a few categories for answers. Since I’m thinking of tracking “dependence”, it makes sense that the more frequent checking gets a higher value. So, this is how I code this variable:\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;%\n    mutate(\n        #timeline : past 3 months \n        mBanking = case_when(\n            ui_050d == 1 ~ 1, # Yes \n            ui_050d == 2 ~ 0, # No \n            .default = -1 # valid skip, don't know, refused, not stated \n        ),\n        \n        SD = case_when(\n            sm_030a == 1 ~ 6, # At least every 5 minutes \n            sm_030a == 2 ~ 5, # At least every 15 minutes \n            sm_030a == 3 ~ 4, # At least every 30 minutes  \n            sm_030a == 4 ~ 3, # One time per hour  \n            sm_030a == 5 ~ 2, # Once a day or a few times per day  \n            sm_030a == 6 ~ 1, # Less than one time per day\n            .default = 96 # Valid skip 96 , Don’t know 97 , Refusal  98, Not stated  99\n        )\n    )\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(SD &lt; 10)\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(mBanking != -1) \n\nThe filters are just making sure that the skip’s, don’t know’s, refusal’s and not stated answers are dropped. This is not too big of a loss.

I have also added a frequency column for these variables only to show you the demographic distribution of the sample (not weighted).\n\n\n\nVariable Name: PROVINCE\n\nConcept: PROVINCE\n\n\nNote:\nInformation derived using postal codes.\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador\n10\n950\n\n\nPrince Edward Island\n11\n1,154\n\n\nNova Scotia\n12\n1,181\n\n\nNew Brunswick\n13\n1,223\n\n\nQuebec\n24\n3,911\n\n\nOntario\n35\n3,719\n\n\nManitoba\n46\n973\n\n\nSaskatchewan\n47\n979\n\n\nAlberta\n48\n1,365\n\n\nBritish Columbia\n59\n1,954\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: AGE_GRP\n\nConcept: Age Groups – Derived variable\n\n\nNote:\nDerived from age of persons in the household\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n15 to 24 years\n01\n828\n\n\n25 to 34 years\n02\n1,805\n\n\n35 to 44 years\n03\n2,520\n\n\n45 to 54 years\n04\n2,469\n\n\n55 to 64 years\n05\n3,889\n\n\n65 years and over\n06\n5,898\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: GENDER\n\nConcept: Gender - Derived variable\n\n\nNote:\nRefers to current gender which may be different from sex assigned at birth and may be different from what is indicated on legal documents. For data quality and confidentiality reasons, and because of the small population being measured, the dissemination of data according to ’Non binary’ Gender is not possible for this statistical program. So, this release uses a gender variable with only two categories. This variable is derived by looking at a large number of demographic characteristics from the respondent, it allows us to disseminate data on Gender that is reliable and unbiased.\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nMale\n1\n8,126\n\n\nFemale\n2\n9,283\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: EMP\n\nConcept: Employment status - Derived variable\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nEmployed\n1\n8,451\n\n\nNot Employed\n2\n8,177\n\n\nValid Skip\n6\n0\n\n\nDon’t Know\n7\n0\n\n\nRefusal\n8\n0\n\n\nNot Stated\n9\n781\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: G_EDU\n\nConcept: Highest certificate - Derived variable\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nHigh school or less\n1\n5,746\n\n\nSome post-secondary (incl. univ certificate)\n2\n5,866\n\n\nUniversity degree\n3\n4,889\n\n\nValid skip\n6\n0\n\n\nDon’t know\n7\n0\n\n\nRefusal\n8\n0\n\n\nNot stated\n9\n908\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: G_HCOMP\n\nConcept: Type of household - Derived variable\n\n\nNote:\nThis derived variable indicates the household composition.

It seems the two relationships are almost identical, at least in direction.\n\nggplot(data    = ds,\n       aes(x   = MH,\n           y   = SD,\n           col = as.factor(mBanking)))+ #to add the colours for different classes\n    geom_point(size     = 1.2,\n             alpha    = .8,\n             position = \"jitter\")+ \n    #scale_color_manual(name = \"MBanking\",\n                     #labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"),\n                     #values = c(\"red\", \"lightblue\")) + #+ ggnewscale::new_scale_color() +\n    geom_smooth(method   = lm,\n              se       = T, \n              size     = 1.5, \n              linetype = 1, \n              alpha    = .7,\n              ) + \n    scale_color_manual(name = \"MBanking\",\n                     labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\"),\n                     values = c(\"black\", \"darkred\")) + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same type of visualizations can be helpful for other factors in the model. Now, I will separate the data into those that have adopted m-banking and those that haven’t. Let’s look at the differences in familial relationship satisfaction for these two groups across mental health. For m-banking adopters, it seems that those with better mental health (3 or higher) are completely satisfied with their family relationships (blue bar). On the other hand, those that haven’t adopted m-banking are either less satisfied or completely unsatisfied (MH = 5, mBanking = 0 group’s largest bar is red, which is FAMSAT = 1, the lowest score).\n\nds1 &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 1)\nds2 &lt;- ds %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 0)\n\ngg5 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds1, aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(FAMSAT)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"FAMSAT\")\n\ngg6 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds2 %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 0), aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(FAMSAT)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"FAMSAT\")\n\nggarrange(gg5, gg6, ncol = 2, labels = c(\"mBanking = 1\", \"mBanking = 0\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s important to mention that visualizations don’t actually tell us the real story. Especially when working with large datasets with more than 10,000 data points. This is simply a somewhat visible pattern that tells me it’s worth looking into when I do my statistical analysis. We do the same type of visualization, now measuring social media use. Surprisingly, social media use goes up with better mental health scores for adopters but decreases for non-adopters.\n\ngg7 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds1, aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(SNS)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"SNS\")\n\ngg8 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds2 %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 0), aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(SNS)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"SNS\")\n\nggarrange(gg7, gg8, ncol = 2, labels = c(\"mBanking = 1\", \"mBanking = 0\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, we do the same with smartphone dependency. It seems that non-adopters are actually more dependent on their smartphones and also (with better mental health).\n\ngg9 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds1, aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(SD)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"SD\")\n\ngg10 &lt;- ggplot(data = ds2 %&gt;% filter(mBanking == 0), aes(x = MH, y = wtpg)) +\n            geom_col(\n            aes(fill = as.factor(SD)), stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\", position = position_dodge(0.9)) +\n            fill_palette(\"RdBu\") + \n            xlab(\"Mental Health\") +\n            ylab(\"Weights\") + labs(fill = \"SD\")\n\nggarrange(gg9, gg10, ncol = 2, labels = c(\"mBanking = 1\", \"mBanking = 0\"))",

    "text": "Modeling\nI prepare the data for modeling by:\n\nCalculating mean-centered values for the numeric columns for easier interpretation since no value has a true zero.\nI convert some variables to factors, which are categorical variables with different levels and define various reference points for each for easier modeling practices\nNote that if a variable’s reference level is l, then all the logistic regression coefficients for other levels are in comparison to level l\n\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% mutate(\n    MH_c = MH - mean(MH), \n    SD_c = SD - mean(SD),\n    SNS_f = as.factor(SNS),\n    RS_c = RS - mean(RS),\n    AGE_c = AGE - mean(AGE),\n    SEX_f = as.factor(SEX),\n    EMP_f = as.factor(EMP),\n    EDU_c = EDU - mean(EDU),\n    FAM_f = as.factor(FAM),\n    INC_c = INC - mean(INC),\n    IMM_f = as.factor(IMM),\n    PRVNC = as.factor(province)\n)\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% \n    mutate(\n        # SEX \n        SEX_factor_Fem = relevel(SEX_f, ref = '2'),\n        SEX_factor_Mal = relevel(SEX_f, ref = '1'),\n        # EMP\n        EMP_factor_not = relevel(EMP_f, ref = '0'),\n        EMP_factor_Emp = relevel(EMP_f, ref = '1'),\n        # FAM \n        FAM_factor_1 = relevel(FAM_f, ref = '1'),\n        FAM_factor_2 = relevel(FAM_f, ref = '2'),\n        FAM_factor_3 = relevel(FAM_f, ref = '3'),\n        FAM_factor_4 = relevel(FAM_f, ref = '4'),\n        # IMM\n        IMM_factor_Imm = relevel(IMM_f, ref = '1'),\n        IMM_factor_non = relevel(IMM_f, ref = '0'),\n        # SNS \n        SNS_factor_notuse = relevel(SNS_f, ref = '0'),\n        SNS_factor_use = relevel(SNS_f, ref = '1')\n    )\n\n\nConsidering Sampling Clusters\nThis dataset was sampled by clustering on provinces. CIUS does not disclose their sample measure in full detail, but it is best practice to consider this sampling design in the model. There are multiple ways to do it:\n\nApply the weights to the model in glm(); since the dataset is quite large, adding the weights will render everything statistically significant and therefore is not useful for our purposes\nUse a survey-specific module like the survey package developed by Thomas Lumley to account for survey methods, stratification, framing, sampling strategy and weights. The way you’d do this is:\n\n\nlibrary(survey)\n\n# define survey design \nds_svy &lt;- svydesign(ids = ~province, weights = ~wtpg, data = ds)\n\n# run survey glm : svyglm()\nmodel1_svy &lt;- svyglm(\n    mBanking ~ MH_c + SD_c + SNS_factor_use + RS_c + AGE_c + SEX_factor_Fem + ..., \n    family=stats::gaussian(),\n    start=NULL, rescale=TRUE, deff=FALSE,influence=FALSE)\n\nsummary(model1_svy, correlation = FALSE, df.resid=NULL)\n\n\nAnother method is to consider robust standard errors\nLastly, the method I’ve decided on is to consider this clustering in the model as a group using mixed-effect models\n\nLet’s visualize the distribution of m-banking adoption across provinces for all MH scores:\n\nds &lt;- ds %&gt;% \n    mutate(\n        province_f_coded = fct_recode(\n            PRVNC,\n            'NL' = '10',\n            'NS' = '12', \n            'NB' = '13',\n            'QC' = '24',\n            'ON' = '35', \n            'MB' = '46', \n            'SK' = '47', \n            'AB' = '48', \n            'BC' = '59'\n        )\n    )\n\n\nggplot(ds, aes(province_f_coded, mBanking, color = as.factor(MH))) +\n                  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"point\") +\n                  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.4) +\n                  theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 10)) +\n                  theme(legend.position = \"top\") +\n                  labs(x = \"Province\", y = \"Observed Probabilty of mobile banking\", color = \"MH\") + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is clearly some variation in the probabilities of m-banking and the effects of MH on this across the provinces.\n\n\nMathematical Modeling\nFollowing the paper, I have these models (I’m skipping over the choise of RS instead of FAMSAT + FRISAT as it was discussed above):\nModel 1. Standard Logistic Regression\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n  & \\ln\\frac{P(Y = 1)}{1 - P(Y = 1)} = \\\\\n  & \\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1} \\ MH + \\ \\beta_2 \\ SD + \\ \\beta_3 \\ D_{SNS_0} + \\ \\beta_4 \\ AGE \\ + \\ \\beta_5 \\ D_{SEX_m} \\\\\n  &  + \\ \\beta_6 \\ D_{EMP_0} \\ + \\ \\beta_7 \\ EDU + \\ \\beta_8 \\ INC \\ + \\ \\beta_9 \\ D_{FAM_1} + \\ \\beta_{10} \\ D_{FAM_3}\\\\\n  & + \\ \\beta_{11} \\ D_{FAM_4} \\ + \\ \\beta_{12} \\ D_{IMM_1} + \\ \\beta_{13} \\ RS + \\ \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nWhere D is a dummy variable representing the case that the value of the variable in the index is some specific level. For example, D_{SNS_0} gets a 1 in every cell where SNS = 0. This is modeled in R:\n\nmodel1 &lt;- glm(\n    mBanking ~ MH_c + SD_c + SNS_factor_use + RS_c + AGE_c + SEX_factor_Fem + EMP_factor_Emp + EDU_c + FAM_factor_2 + IMM_factor_non + INC_c,\n    data = ds,\n    family = \"binomial\"\n)\n\nModel 2. Fixed Effect Logistic Regression\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n  & \\ln\\frac{P(Y = 1)}{1 - P(Y = 1)} = \\\\\n  & \\ \\gamma_{0,j} + u_{0,j} + \\beta_{1} \\ MH + \\ \\beta_2 \\ SD + \\ \\beta_3 \\ D_{SNS_0} + \\ \\beta_4 \\ AGE \\ + \\ \\beta_5 \\ D_{SEX_m}\\\\\n  &  + \\ \\beta_6 \\ D_{EMP_0} \\ + \\ \\beta_7 \\ EDU + \\ \\beta_8 \\ INC \\ + \\ \\beta_9 \\ D_{FAM_1} + \\ \\beta_{10} \\ D_{FAM_3}\\\\\n  & + \\ \\beta_{11} \\ D_{FAM_4} \\ + \\ \\beta_{12} \\ D_{IMM_1} + \\ \\beta_{13} \\ RS + \\ \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThis is where province only affects the intercept (m-banking). I used the glmer function from the lme4 package.\n\nmodel2 &lt;- glmer(\n    mBanking ~ MH_c + SD_c + SNS_factor_use + RS_c + AGE_c + SEX_factor_Fem + EMP_factor_Emp + EDU_c + FAM_factor_2 + IMM_factor_non + INC_c + (1 | province),\n    data = ds,\n    family = binomial(),\n    control = glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\")\n)\n\nModel 3. Random Effect Logistic Regression\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n   & \\ln\\frac{P(Y = 1)}{1 - P(Y = 1)} = \\\\\n   & \\ \\gamma_{0,0} + u_{0,j} + (\\gamma_{1,0} + u_{1,j}) \\ MH + \\ (\\gamma_{2,0} + u_{2,j}) \\ SD \\ + \\ (\\gamma_{3,0} + u_{3,j}) \\ SNS \\\\\n   & + \\ (\\gamma_{4,0} + u_{4,j}) \\ AGE \\ + \\ (\\gamma_{5,0} + u_{5,j}) \\ SEX \\ + \\ (\\gamma_{6,0} + u_{6,j}) EMP \\\\\n   & + \\ (\\gamma_{7,0} + u_{7,j}) \\ EDU \\ + \\ (\\gamma_{8,0} + u_{8,j}) \\ INC \\\n    + \\ (\\gamma_{9,0} + u_{9,j}) \\ D_{FAM_1} \\\\\n   & + \\ (\\gamma_{10,0} + u_{10,j}) \\ D_{FAM_3} \\ + \\ (\\gamma_{11,0} + u_{11,j}) \\ D_{FAM_4} \\\\\n   & + \\ (\\gamma_{12,0} + u_{12,j}) \\ IMM_1 \\ + \\ (\\gamma_{13,0} + u_{13,j}) \\ RS + \\ \\epsilon \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThis is where province only affects everything. This model may not converge (it does in this case, but it takes about 30 minutes with no other processes running on a Macbook Air M2). An easier model that considers random effects may be to just include the random effect on the primary variable MH and its related constructs (model4).\n\nmodel3 &lt;- glmer(\n    mBanking ~ MH_c + SD_c + SNS_factor_use + RS_c + AGE_c + SEX_factor_Fem + EMP_factor_Emp + EDU_c + FAM_factor_2 + IMM_factor_non + INC_c + \n    (1 + MH_c + SD_c + SNS + RS_c + AGE_c + SEX_f + EMP + EDU_c + FAM_2 + IMM_n + \n    INC_c | province),\n    data = ds,\n    family = binomial(link = \"logit\"),\n    control = glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\n\nFor faster speeds, I’ll test everything with this model (random):\n\nmodel4 &lt;- glmer(\n    mBanking ~ MH_c + SD_c + SNS_factor_use + RS_c + AGE_c + SEX_factor_Fem + EMP_factor_Emp + EDU_c + FAM_factor_2 + IMM_factor_non + INC_c + \n    (1 + MH_c + SD_c + SNS_factor_use + RS_c | province),\n    data = ds,\n    family = binomial(link = \"logit\"),\n    control = glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\n\n\n\nComparing models\nSince model3 doesn’t run fast and I am using Quarto for rendering the code blocks, I decided to use model4 for comparisons. The values here will be different from the paper, but the ideas are the same. To pick the best model I do:\n\nLikelihood Ratio Test to pick between model1 vs model2 - the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the models (if you reject this, then you should go with the model that captures more information)\n\nIf you reject H_0 of LR test, i.e., model2 wins \\implies we compare it to model4 and we need the Hausman test\n\nUnfortunately, the Hausman test requires the plm package and panel data. To avoid messing the data up again, I coded the calculations manually based on the Hausman formula. This is referenced in the paper.\n\nIf you can’t reject H_0 of LR test, i.e., model1 wins, we should just use that as it’s simpler\n\n\n\ntest_performance(model1, model2)\n\nName   |    Model |     BF | df | df_diff |  Chi2 |      p\n----------------------------------------------------------\nmodel1 |      glm |        | 14 |         |       |       \nmodel2 | glmerMod | 333.29 | 15 |    1.00 | 20.94 | &lt; .001\nModels were detected as nested (in terms of fixed parameters) and are compared in sequential order.\n\n\nSince model2 won, we now compare it with model4. Hausman test for fixed effects in R is a bit tricky, so, I did it manually following the formula:\n\nExtract per-group (province) coefficients for both models and convert them to data frames\n\n\ncoefs_fixed &lt;- coef(model2)\ncoefs_rando &lt;- coef(model4)\n\ncoefs_fixed_df &lt;- as.data.frame(coefs_fixed$province)\ncoefs_rando_df &lt;- as.data.frame(coefs_rando$province)\n\n\nSubtract Random Effects model coefficients from Fixed Effect model, per province.

The y-axis shows the intercept shift (effect) for each province. A higher value on the y-axis (positive effect) means that after controlling for all variables, people in that province have higher baseline odds of using m-banking. A lower value (negative effect) means lower baseline odds. Since Quebec (QC) and British Columbia (BC) have the highest positive effects, we can say mobile banking is more common there, even after accounting for mental health and other variables. On the opposite end, Alberta (AB) and Newfoundland & Labrador (NL) have the lowest random effects, meaning adoption is lower in these provinces.\n\nprov_ &lt;- c('NL', 'NS', 'NB', 'QC', 'ON', 'MB', 'SK', 'AB', 'BC')\nprov_n &lt;- c(10, 12, 13, 24, 35, 46, 47, 48, 59)\n\n# random effects are from model 2 \nranefs_ &lt;- c(-0.029445800, 0.001523515,-0.034782017, 0.308732844,-0.132427568,-0.129533645,-0.047807245,-0.001728474,0.053000416)\nranefs_ &lt;- round(ranefs_, 4)\n\nd_graph &lt;- cbind(prov_, prov_n, ranefs_)\nd_graph &lt;- as.data.frame(d_graph)\n\nprovs_fullnames &lt;- c('Newfoundland and Labrador', 'Nova Scotia', 'New Brunswick','Quebec', 'Ontario', 'Manitoba', 'Saskatchewan', 'Alberta', 'British Columbia')\n\n\nggplot(data = d_graph, aes(x = prov_n, y = ranefs_, label = c('NL', 'NS', 'NB', 'QC', 'ON', 'MB', 'SK', 'AB', 'BC'))) +   \n    geom_point(size = 2, alpha = .5) + \n    geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE) + \n    labs(\n        x = \"Province Code\",\n        y = \"Random Effect\",\n        fill = \"Province\"\n    ) + geom_label(aes(fill = provs_fullnames), colour = \"white\", fontface = \"bold\") + geom_line(linetype = \"dashed\") + \n    scale_color_manual(values = provs_fullnames, name = \"province\")",

    "text": "In this project, I focused on analyzing how mental health relates to mobile banking adoption. I used data from the Canadian Internet Use Survey 2022, which includes questions about various digital habits, and demographics. You can find the dataset here.\nFor this project, I conducted a comparative analysis of two logistic regression models one for smartphone users, refered to from here on out and PHONE users and one for smart wearable users, refered to as WEAR users. Since the sampling methodology involved clustering by provinces, I considered robust standard errors for reporting the results. To build the models, I needed to conceptualize technology, in this case, m-banking adoption. Since I’m considering two different devices, I needed factors that impact m-banking decisions for both devices to be able to compare them.\nThis was very challenging because there are not many m-banking using smartwearable device studies! So, I broadened the scope to consider any technology adoption. This is ok to do as long as the factors are not specific to a niche context. The variables are Trust, Perceived Security, Perceived Value, and few demographic varaibles such as Age, Gender, Education and Income.\nHere are my hypotheses:\n\nH1: The association between Trust and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users\nH2: The association between Perceived security and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\nH3: The association between Perceived value (measured by time savings) and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\n\nH4.1 : The association between Age and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\nH4.2 : The association between Gender and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\nH4.3 : The association between Education and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\nH4.4 : The association between Income and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\n\n\n\n\nNote that not all libraries may be utilized. The most important ones are dplyr, lme4, tidyr, lavaan, ggplot2, psych, corrr, haven, poLCA and any related libraries to these.\n\nlibrary(corrr)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(lavaan)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(rempsyc)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(report)\nlibrary(effectsize)\nlibrary(aod)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ROCR)\nlibrary(jtools)\nlibrary(xtable)\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(nlme)\nlibrary(weights)\nlibrary(miscTools)\nlibrary(systemfit)\nlibrary(multcomp)\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(GGally)\nrequire(reshape2)\nrequire(lattice)\nlibrary(HLMdiag)\nlibrary(margins)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\nlibrary(effects)\nlibrary(margins)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(plm)\nlibrary(effectsize)\nlibrary(aod)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(foreign)\nlibrary(AER)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(formatR)\nlibrary(pglm)\nlibrary(acqr)\nlibrary(lmtest)\nlibrary(poLCA)\nlibrary(mirt)\nlibrary(texreg)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset is very similar to CIUS 2020 from study 2. I first started by reading the entire PUMF file available.\nThis gives you information on how the survey was set up, why, and how things were measured. Then, I looked at the individual survey questions to see the available data, and how they were measured. In general, questions are measured numerically were answeres follow as such:\n\nYes : 1 No : 2\nValid Skip: 6 Don’t Know: 7 Refusal: 8 Not Stated: 9\n\nOf course this differs question-by-question as some questions have other answer categories and some questions (which were note used in my study) asked for numerical input from the participants (like how much did you spend online last year). To help readers understand the data, I will include the question exactly as it appears in the CIUS 2022 PUMF Data Dictionary with corresponding answer choices and codes. These will be in a blue-bordered box, and will include the Variable name (on the PUMF file), Concept, Question Body and Answers. Then I will show you in R code how I’ve re-coded and used the question as a model variable. The Variables I need are as follows:\n\nMobile banking adoption (MBANK)\nProvince (PRVNC)\nAge Group (AGE)\nGender (SEX)\nEducation Level (EDU)\nIncome Quintile (INCOME)\nUser Type (USR_TYP) - based on the following\n\nSmartphone User (isSmartPhone)\nSmartwearable User (isSmartWear)\n\nSaved Time Because of m-banking (EFF_TIME)\nPerceived Security (PSEC) - based on the following\n\nSecurity measure: restricting access to location (SEC_RES_LOC)\nSecurity measure: restricting access to data (SEC_RES_DAT)\nSecurity check: checked security of a website (SEC_ACC_WEBSEC)\nSecurity check: changed privacy settings (SEC_ACC_CHNGPRV)\nSecurity feature: security questions (SECOPT_QS)\nSecurity feature: partner login (SECOPT_PL)\nSecurity feature: two factor authentication (SECOPT_2FA)\nSecurity feature: biometric (SECOPT_BIO)\nSecurity feature: password manager (SECOPT_PAS)\n\nTrust in Banks (TRST_BANK)\nFamily Relation Satisfaction (FAMSAT)\n\nThe data is available in various formats. To avoid data loss, I decided to use the .dta format (SAS file). You need the haven package to read SAS files. This is how you’d read a SAS file:\n\ndata_2022 &lt;- read_dta(\"data/00_CIUS2022.dta\")\nds00 &lt;- data_2022\ndim(ds00)\n\n[1] 25118   342\n\n\n\nds0 &lt;- ds00\n\n\n\n\n\nRenaming variables\nCleaning data: delete the skips and such for both categorical and numerical variables\nVerifying that our measure of latent constructs are strong enough\n\n\n\n\nSince these are not direct questions but information retrieved from other sources (such as postal codes for province), some of them do not have Skips/Don’t Know/Refusal/Not Stated answers. If they have, I have added those to the cards.\nProvince, Age, Sex, Education, Income:\n\n\n\nVariable Name: PROVINCE\n\nConcept: PROVINCE\n\n\nQuestion Text/Note:\nInformation derived using postal codes.\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador\n10\n\n\nPrince Edward Island\n11\n\n\nNova Scotia\n12\n\n\nNew Brunswick\n13\n\n\nQuebec\n24\n\n\nOntario\n35\n\n\nManitoba\n46\n\n\nSaskatchewan\n47\n\n\nAlberta\n48\n\n\nBritish Columbia\n59\n\n\nValid skip\n96\n\n\nDon’t know\n97\n\n\nRefusal\n98\n\n\nNot stated\n99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: AGE_GRP\n\nConcept: Age Groups - Derived variable\n\n\nQuestion Text/Note:\nInformation derived from age of persons in household.\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\n15 to 24 years\n01\n\n\n25 to 34 years\n02\n\n\n35 to 44 years\n03\n\n\n45 to 54 years\n04\n\n\n55 to 64 years\n05\n\n\n65 years and over\n06\n\n\nValid skip\n96\n\n\nDon’t know\n97\n\n\nRefusal\n98\n\n\nNot stated\n99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: GENDER\n\nConcept: Gender - Derived variable\n\n\nQuestion Text/Note:\nRefers to current gender which may be different from sex assigned at birth and may be different from what is indicated on legal documents.

    "text": "In this project, I focused on analyzing how mental health relates to mobile banking adoption. I used data from the Canadian Internet Use Survey 2022, which includes questions about various digital habits, and demographics. You can find the dataset here.\nFor this project, I conducted a comparative analysis of two logistic regression models one for smartphone users, refered to from here on out and PHONE users and one for smart wearable users, refered to as WEAR users. Since the sampling methodology involved clustering by provinces, I considered robust standard errors for reporting the results. To build the models, I needed to conceptualize technology, in this case, m-banking adoption. Since I’m considering two different devices, I needed factors that impact m-banking decisions for both devices to be able to compare them.\nThis was very challenging because there are not many m-banking using smartwearable device studies! So, I broadened the scope to consider any technology adoption. This is ok to do as long as the factors are not specific to a niche context. The variables are Trust, Perceived Security, Perceived Value, and few demographic varaibles such as Age, Gender, Education and Income.\nHere are my hypotheses:\n\nH1: The association between Trust and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users\nH2: The association between Perceived security and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\nH3: The association between Perceived value (measured by time savings) and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\n\nH4.1 : The association between Age and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\nH4.2 : The association between Gender and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\nH4.3 : The association between Education and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\nH4.4 : The association between Income and m-banking adoption is the same for smartphone and smart wearable users.\n\n\n\n\nNote that not all libraries may be utilized. The most important ones are dplyr, lme4, tidyr, lavaan, ggplot2, psych, corrr, haven, poLCA and any related libraries to these.\n\nlibrary(corrr)\nlibrary(psych)\nlibrary(lavaan)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(rempsyc)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(report)\nlibrary(effectsize)\nlibrary(aod)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(ROCR)\nlibrary(jtools)\nlibrary(xtable)\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(nlme)\nlibrary(weights)\nlibrary(miscTools)\nlibrary(systemfit)\nlibrary(multcomp)\nrequire(ggplot2)\nrequire(GGally)\nrequire(reshape2)\nrequire(lattice)\nlibrary(HLMdiag)\nlibrary(margins)\nlibrary(performance)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\nlibrary(marginaleffects)\nlibrary(effects)\nlibrary(margins)\nlibrary(modelr)\nlibrary(plm)\nlibrary(effectsize)\nlibrary(aod)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidymodels)\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nlibrary(glmnet)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(foreign)\nlibrary(AER)\nlibrary(lme4)\nlibrary(formatR)\nlibrary(pglm)\nlibrary(acqr)\nlibrary(lmtest)\nlibrary(poLCA)\nlibrary(mirt)\nlibrary(texreg)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset is very similar to CIUS 2020 from study 2. I first started by reading the entire PUMF file available.\nThis gives you information on how the survey was set up, why, and how things were measured. Then, I looked at the individual survey questions to see the available data, and how they were measured. In general, questions are measured numerically were answeres follow as such:\n\nYes : 1 No : 2\nValid Skip: 6 Don’t Know: 7 Refusal: 8 Not Stated: 9\n\nOf course this differs question-by-question as some questions have other answer categories and some questions (which were note used in my study) asked for numerical input from the participants (like how much did you spend online last year). To help readers understand the data, I will include the question exactly as it appears in the CIUS 2022 PUMF Data Dictionary with corresponding answer choices and codes. These will be in a blue-bordered box, and will include the Variable name (on the PUMF file), Concept, Question Body and Answers. Then I will show you in R code how I’ve re-coded and used the question as a model variable. The Variables I need are as follows:\n\nMobile banking adoption (MBANK)\nProvince (PRVNC)\nAge Group (AGE)\nGender (SEX)\nEducation Level (EDU)\nIncome Quintile (INCOME)\nUser Type (USR_TYP) - based on the following\n\nSmartphone User (isSmartPhone)\nSmartwearable User (isSmartWear)\n\nSaved Time Because of m-banking (EFF_TIME)\nPerceived Security (PSEC) - based on the following\n\nSecurity measure: restricting access to location (SEC_RES_LOC)\nSecurity measure: restricting access to data (SEC_RES_DAT)\nSecurity check: checked security of a website (SEC_ACC_WEBSEC)\nSecurity check: changed privacy settings (SEC_ACC_CHNGPRV)\nSecurity feature: security questions (SECOPT_QS)\nSecurity feature: partner login (SECOPT_PL)\nSecurity feature: two factor authentication (SECOPT_2FA)\nSecurity feature: biometric (SECOPT_BIO)\nSecurity feature: password manager (SECOPT_PAS)\n\nTrust in Banks (TRST_BANK)\nFamily Relation Satisfaction (FAMSAT)\n\nThe data is available in various formats. To avoid data loss, I decided to use the .dta format (SAS file). You need the haven package to read SAS files. This is how you’d read a SAS file:\n\ndata_2022 &lt;- read_dta(\"data/00_CIUS2022.dta\")\nds00 &lt;- data_2022\ndim(ds00)\n\n[1] 25118   342\n\n\n\nds0 &lt;- ds00\n\n\n\n\n\nRenaming variables\nCleaning data: delete the skips and such for both categorical and numerical variables\nVerifying that our measure of latent constructs are strong enough\n\n\n\n\nSince these are not direct questions but information retrieved from other sources (such as postal codes for province), some of them do not have Skips/Don’t Know/Refusal/Not Stated answers. If they have, I have added those to the cards.\nProvince, Age, Sex, Education, Income:\n\n\n\nVariable Name: PROVINCE\n\nConcept: PROVINCE\n\n\nQuestion Text/Note:\nInformation derived using postal codes.\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador\n10\n\n\nPrince Edward Island\n11\n\n\nNova Scotia\n12\n\n\nNew Brunswick\n13\n\n\nQuebec\n24\n\n\nOntario\n35\n\n\nManitoba\n46\n\n\nSaskatchewan\n47\n\n\nAlberta\n48\n\n\nBritish Columbia\n59\n\n\nValid skip\n96\n\n\nDon’t know\n97\n\n\nRefusal\n98\n\n\nNot stated\n99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: AGE_GRP\n\nConcept: Age Groups - Derived variable\n\n\nQuestion Text/Note:\nInformation derived from age of persons in household.\n\n\n\nAnswer Categories\nCode\n\n\n\n\n15 to 24 years\n01\n\n\n25 to 34 years\n02\n\n\n35 to 44 years\n03\n\n\n45 to 54 years\n04\n\n\n55 to 64 years\n05\n\n\n65 years and over\n06\n\n\nValid skip\n96\n\n\nDon’t know\n97\n\n\nRefusal\n98\n\n\nNot stated\n99\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name: GENDER\n\nConcept: Gender - Derived variable\n\n\nQuestion Text/Note:\nRefers to current gender which may be different from sex assigned at birth and may be different from what is indicated on legal documents.

    "text": "Perceived Security Measurement\nSince there is no perceived security measure I need to define it as a latent variable. In the CIUS2022, there’s no single, direct question asking:\n\nHow secure do you think mobile banking is?\n\nThat means “Perceived Security” isn’t directly measured. However, we have multiple related questions (e.g., about data protection, privacy, security measures, etc.). These indirect items are observable variables that reflect an unobservable (latent) concept: the user’s overall perception of security.\nI use Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to test if these items really reflect one underlying factor, i.e., PSEC. This increases measurement reliability. Here are the steps of CFA:\nStep 1. Reliability Check\nUsing Cronbach’s Alpha, I check the internal consistency of the items. Usually, if \\alpha &gt; 0.7, the items are measuring the same idea.\n\nalph &lt;- psych::alpha(wrk_ds[, c(\"SEC_RES_LOC\", \"SEC_RES_DAT\", \"SEC_ACC_WEBSEC\", \"SEC_ACC_CHNGPRV\", \n            \"SECOPT_QS\", \"SECOPT_PL\", \"SECOPT_2FA\", \n            \"SECOPT_BIO\", \"SECOPT_PAS\")])\n\nalph$total$raw_alpha\n\n[1] 0.8103267\n\n\nWhich means the measurement is strong.\nStep 2. Exploratory Factor Check\nWith Parallel Analysis, I can decide how many factors to extract.\n\nfa.parallel(wrk_ds[, c(\"SEC_RES_LOC\", \"SEC_RES_DAT\", \"SEC_ACC_WEBSEC\", \"SEC_ACC_CHNGPRV\", \n                       \"SECOPT_QS\", \"SECOPT_PL\", \"SECOPT_2FA\", \"SECOPT_BIO\", \"SECOPT_PAS\")], \n            fa = \"fa\")\n\n\nNote: the eighenvalue on the y-axis is basically the varaince each factor explains\nFrom a parallel scree plot, you should look for an “elbow” - this is where the curve changes direction, which looks like 2 here. Parallel analysis suggests 2 separate factors. That is, it could be that the factors I’m looking at are actually describing two different latent ideas:\n\nMaybe security measures like questions, 2FA, biometrics\nand security concerns overall, like not allowing access to location or data\n\nHowever, I still think they’re basically both perceptions of security of an app. You only do these things if you think the app is not secure or you’re worried about security. So, I’ll keep these factors and decide if something should be combined or dropped from CFA results.\nStep 3. Confirmatory Factor Analysis\nThe mathematical model is \nX_i = \\lambda_i PSEC_i + \\epsilon_i\n Where X_i’s are the observed variables, \\lambda_i is factor loading of varaible i and \\epsilon is the error term. This is as if asking “can all 9 items be explained by 1 variable (PSEC)?”. I’m adding covariances to improve the model fit. How did I decide how to add covariates (this notation \\sim\\sim)? Trial and error, tbh! But also, mostly intuitive. The questions about security measures like setting up 2FA, questions, biometrics, password managers and partner login are all kind of related (to the same idea of “setting up and using security measures/features”). They have the same context on CIUS questionnairs, too. Similarly, the data and location access are kind of about the same idea: they’re both restrictions on what is shared about you.

So, it’s a good idea to add a covariance for them to the model. However, adding too much risks complicating the model and potentially overfitting. Since my analysis so far shows strong fit (above 90% CFI), I stop here. However, there’s room for improvement!\nStep 5. Check Sample-sized control RMSEA\nSince my sample size is quite large, the RMSEA is affected. In fact, all the metrics (especially \\chi^2) are. So, I’ll calculate the sample-sized normalized RMSEA:\n\nfitmeasures(compatibility_fac, \"rmsea\") / sqrt(18552)\n\nrmsea \n    0 \n\n\nAnd check the reliability of the model:\n\n# reliability(compatibility_fac) --- 82%\n\nStep 6. Subgroup Analysis\nBefore we define PSEC, I have to figure out how many different categories I want. The smallest would be 2: high and low. I want to check for unobserved subgroups/subclasses. This is called Latent Class Analysis (LCA). Since the values for the items had 0’s in them, I have to add 1’s to everything (required for poLCA).\n\nwrk_ds[, c(\"SEC_RES_LOC\", \"SEC_RES_DAT\", \"SEC_ACC_WEBSEC\", \"SEC_ACC_CHNGPRV\",\n           \"SECOPT_QS\", \"SECOPT_PL\", \"SECOPT_2FA\", \"SECOPT_BIO\", \"SECOPT_PAS\")] &lt;- \n  wrk_ds[, c(\"SEC_RES_LOC\", \"SEC_RES_DAT\", \"SEC_ACC_WEBSEC\", \"SEC_ACC_CHNGPRV\",\n             \"SECOPT_QS\", \"SECOPT_PL\", \"SECOPT_2FA\", \"SECOPT_BIO\", \"SECOPT_PAS\")] + 1\n\nform &lt;- cbind(SEC_RES_LOC, SEC_RES_DAT, SEC_ACC_WEBSEC, SEC_ACC_CHNGPRV,\n            SECOPT_QS, SECOPT_PL, SECOPT_2FA, SECOPT_BIO, SECOPT_PAS) ~ 1\n\n# Run LCA with 2 latent classes\nlca_model &lt;- poLCA(form, data = wrk_ds, nclass = 2, maxiter = 5000)\n\nConditional item response (column) probabilities,\n by outcome variable, for each class (row) \n \n$SEC_RES_LOC\n           Pr(1)  Pr(2)\nclass 1:  0.6822 0.3178\nclass 2:  0.1056 0.8944\n\n$SEC_RES_DAT\n           Pr(1)  Pr(2)\nclass 1:  0.7381 0.2619\nclass 2:  0.1067 0.8933\n\n$SEC_ACC_WEBSEC\n           Pr(1)  Pr(2)\nclass 1:  0.8797 0.1203\nclass 2:  0.3350 0.6650\n\n$SEC_ACC_CHNGPRV\n           Pr(1)  Pr(2)\nclass 1:  0.8775 0.1225\nclass 2:  0.2212 0.7788\n\n$SECOPT_QS\n           Pr(1)  Pr(2)\nclass 1:  0.7263 0.2737\nclass 2:  0.2124 0.7876\n\n$SECOPT_PL\n           Pr(1)  Pr(2)\nclass 1:  0.9084 0.0916\nclass 2:  0.5167 0.4833\n\n$SECOPT_2FA\n           Pr(1)  Pr(2)\nclass 1:  0.5936 0.4064\nclass 2:  0.0585 0.9415\n\n$SECOPT_BIO\n           Pr(1)  Pr(2)\nclass 1:  0.8906 0.1094\nclass 2:  0.4840 0.5160\n\n$SECOPT_PAS\n           Pr(1)  Pr(2)\nclass 1:  0.8515 0.1485\nclass 2:  0.4569 0.5431\n\nEstimated class population shares \n 0.3951 0.6049 \n \nPredicted class memberships (by modal posterior prob.) \n 0.3843 0.6157 \n \n========================================================= \nFit for 2 latent classes: \n========================================================= \nnumber of observations: 18552 \nnumber of estimated parameters: 19 \nresidual degrees of freedom: 492 \nmaximum log-likelihood: -93737.84 \n \nAIC(2): 187513.7\nBIC(2): 187662.4\nG^2(2): 9189.15 (Likelihood ratio/deviance statistic) \nX^2(2): 17134.16 (Chi-square goodness of fit) \n \n\nsummary(lca_model)\n\n               Length Class      Mode   \nllik               1  -none-     numeric\nattempts           1  -none-     numeric\nprobs.start        9  -none-     list   \nprobs              9  -none-     list   \nprobs.se           9  -none-     list   \nP.se               2  -none-     numeric\nposterior      37104  -none-     numeric\npredclass      18552  -none-     numeric\nP                  2  -none-     numeric\nnumiter            1  -none-     numeric\nprobs.start.ok     1  -none-     logical\ncoeff              1  -none-     logical\ncoeff.se           1  -none-     logical\ncoeff.V            1  -none-     logical\neflag              1  -none-     logical\nnpar               1  -none-     numeric\naic                1  -none-     numeric\nbic                1  -none-     numeric\nNobs               1  -none-     numeric\nChisq              1  -none-     numeric\npredcell          11  data.frame list   \nGsq                1  -none-     numeric\ny                  9  data.frame list   \nx                  1  data.frame list   \nN                  1  -none-     numeric\nmaxiter            1  -none-     numeric\nresid.df           1  -none-     numeric\ntime               1  difftime   numeric\ncall               5  -none-     call   \n\n\nEssentially, I’m grouping people into classes based on their security attitudes using the 9 items that I have. Let’s check the 2 classes results. How to interpret the results:\n\nFirst, Pr(1) is probability the person in class x picks 1 for an item (1 here is the previous 0). So:\n\n\n$SEC_RES_LOC\nPr(1), class 1: 0.68\nPr(2), class 2: 0.11\n\nMeans people in class 1 are more likely to not restrict their location (SEC_RES_LOC = 0 has a higher chance in class 1). This can just be people with high and low security tolerance. The Estimated class population shares for classes are very close to the prediction of my model, i.e., Predicted class memberships (by modal posterior prob.). This means these are very good estimates. The fit statistics shows: AIC, BIC, deviance, and \\chi^2.\nNow let’s try for 2,3 and 4 classes and pick the best - using AIC/BIC (lower = better fit):\n\ninvisible(capture.output({lca_2 &lt;- poLCA(form, data = wrk_ds, nclass = 2)}))\ninvisible(capture.output({lca_3 &lt;- poLCA(form, data = wrk_ds, nclass = 3)}))\ninvisible(capture.output({lca_4 &lt;- poLCA(form, data = wrk_ds, nclass = 4)}))\n\n# Compare AIC and BIC\ndata.frame(\n  Classes = 2:4,\n  AIC = c(lca_2$aic, lca_3$aic, lca_4$aic),\n  BIC = c(lca_2$bic, lca_3$bic, lca_4$bic)\n)\n\n  Classes      AIC      BIC\n1       2 187513.7 187662.4\n2       3 183851.6 184078.7\n3       4 180666.1 180971.4\n\n\nThis is telling me PSEC should have 4 levels.\nStep 7. Calculate Perceived Security\nAnother way to define PSEC is to use Item Response Theory (1 parameter logistic model, Rasch Model). This will give a continous value for PSEC, which is preferrable for my analysis. Each item shares the same slope and I estimate\n\nP(Y_{ij} = 1) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{PSEC_j - b_i}}\n\nWhere PSEC_j is person j’s perceived security and b_i is item i’s threshold. The idea is of b_i is: how hard is it for someone to agree with something. So, in my example, how high/low does the person’s security perception have to be to skip setting up 2FA/set up 2FA.\n\nNote: IF PSEC = b, then the person has a 50-50 chance of agreeing.\n\nBottom line:\n\nIf an item has high threshold, only those with high perceived security agree with it.\nIf an item has low thresholds, most agree with.\n\nSo, let’s define PSEC:\n\n# Run a 1-parameter logistic model (Rasch Model)\nirt_model &lt;- mirt(wrk_ds[, c(\"SEC_RES_LOC\", \"SEC_RES_DAT\", \"SEC_ACC_WEBSEC\",\n                             \"SEC_ACC_CHNGPRV\", \"SECOPT_QS\", \"SECOPT_PL\",\n                             \"SECOPT_2FA\", \"SECOPT_BIO\", \"SECOPT_PAS\")], 1, itemtype=\"Rasch\")\n\n\nIteration: 1, Log-Lik: -94814.100, Max-Change: 0.40153\nIteration: 2, Log-Lik: -93680.902, Max-Change: 0.41232\nIteration: 3, Log-Lik: -93047.348, Max-Change: 0.36846\nIteration: 4, Log-Lik: -92734.044, Max-Change: 0.29365\nIteration: 5, Log-Lik: -92591.472, Max-Change: 0.21441\nIteration: 6, Log-Lik: -92529.943, Max-Change: 0.14683\nIteration: 7, Log-Lik: -92504.107, Max-Change: 0.09617\nIteration: 8, Log-Lik: -92493.300, Max-Change: 0.06119\nIteration: 9, Log-Lik: -92488.690, Max-Change: 0.03822\nIteration: 10, Log-Lik: -92486.647, Max-Change: 0.02357\nIteration: 11, Log-Lik: -92485.693, Max-Change: 0.01445\nIteration: 12, Log-Lik: -92485.221, Max-Change: 0.00882\nIteration: 13, Log-Lik: -92484.970, Max-Change: 0.00567\nIteration: 14, Log-Lik: -92484.829, Max-Change: 0.00316\nIteration: 15, Log-Lik: -92484.756, Max-Change: 0.00192\nIteration: 16, Log-Lik: -92484.712, Max-Change: 0.00125\nIteration: 17, Log-Lik: -92484.685, Max-Change: 0.00070\nIteration: 18, Log-Lik: -92484.670, Max-Change: 0.00040\nIteration: 19, Log-Lik: -92484.661, Max-Change: 0.00028\nIteration: 20, Log-Lik: -92484.655, Max-Change: 0.00015\nIteration: 21, Log-Lik: -92484.652, Max-Change: 0.00009\n\n# Extract person-level scores (PSEC)\nwrk_ds$PSEC &lt;- fscores(irt_model)\n\nThis is a 1-factor model (PSEC).

Let’s consider \\hat{\\beta_{p1}} the estimated coefficient of variable 1 from the PHON only model and \\hat{beta_{w1}} the same variable’s estimate coefficient in WEAR only model. I want to know, is the difference between the two significantly different from zero? That is, H_0: \\hat{\\beta_{p1}} - \\hat{\\beta_{w1}} = 0. If I reject H_0, that means they’re significantly different. The statistic is calculated as the ratio of the estimate (difference) over the standard error the estimate (difference): \nZ = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_{p1}} - \\hat{\\beta_{w1}}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\beta_{p1}} + \\sigma_{\\beta_{w1}}}}\n\n\ncalc_wald_test &lt;- function(model1, model2, variable_name){\n    coeff1 &lt;- model1[variable_name, 1]\n    coeff2 &lt;- model2[variable_name, 1]\n    \n    se1 &lt;- model1[variable_name, 2]\n    se2 &lt;- model1[variable_name, 2]\n    \n    diff &lt;- coeff1 - coeff2\n    se_diff &lt;- sqrt(se1^2 + se2^2)\n    z &lt;- diff / se_diff\n    p &lt;- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z)))\n    res &lt;- c(z = z, p = p)\n\n    return(res)\n}\n\nHere’s how you do this:\n\nGet the results for FullData vs PHON\nGet the results for FullData vs WEAR\nGet the results for PHON vs WEAR\n\n\ncoefs_ &lt;- c('AGE_f1', 'AGE_f3','AGE_f4','AGE_f5','AGE_f6',\n            'SEX_f1',\n            'EDU_f2','EDU_f3',\n            'INCOME_f2','INCOME_f3','INCOME_f4','INCOME_f5',\n            'EFF_TIME_f1', \n            'TRST_BANK_f1','TRST_BANK_f2','TRST_BANK_f3','TRST_BANK_f4',\n            'PSEC')\n    \n\nresults &lt;- c()\n\n# Loop through coefficients and format results\nfor (coef_ in coefs_) {\n\n    full_vs_phone &lt;- calc_wald_test(model_full_summary_clustered, model_phon_summary_clustered, coef_)\n    full_vs_wear &lt;- calc_wald_test(model_full_summary_clustered, model_wear_summary_clustered, coef_)\n    phone_vs_wear &lt;- calc_wald_test(model_phon_summary_clustered, model_wear_summary_clustered, coef_)\n    \n  ## Check significance (if p &gt; 0.05, set as \"no\", otherwise keep z-score)\n  # the dollar signs and ^{} are because I wanted to copy paste the results into LaTeX overleaf !

    "title": "The Inner Workings of Mobile Banking Adoption: A Systematic Literature Review of Intrinsic Factors",
    "section": "Parts of the paper",
    "text": "Parts of the paper\nI’ll briefly introduce the three main parts of this research. I didn’t have time to write these sections, but verbally explained to Gemini what I wanted and only edited it a little bit after. It sounds too academic, but not that scary:\n\nTopic Modeling\nTopic modeling is a crucial step in analyzing text data to identify patterns and themes within a collection of articles. In this chapter, the process begins with extracting text from PDF files using PyMuPDF and then cleaning the text by converting it to lowercase, removing special characters, extra spaces, and stop words using NLTK. The cleaned text is then broken down into uni-grams (single words) and bi-grams (word pairs) through a process called tokenizing.\nTo identify the most important tokens, the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method is applied, followed by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover latent topics within the corpus. LDA models documents as mixtures of latent topics, where each topic is represented by a distribution of words. The number of topics for the LDA algorithm is determined by evaluating models with a range of topics (|T|\\in[5,15]) and selecting the number that yields the highest coherence score, which indicates better model performance. For this study, eight topics were found to be optimal when using bi-grams.\nThe LDA-generated topics are then clarified and categorized. Tokens are grouped into categories such as Perceptive (perception-related), Psychological (cognition, emotions, mind), Personal (individual characteristics), Demographic (age, gender, income, education), Cultural (country, region, religion, culture), External (universally experienced, extrinsic factors), Market (technologies, devices), and Generic (unclassified or vague). Generic and external tokens are excluded from theme classification to maintain focus on intrinsic factors.\nFor a walk through of this part, read Topic Modeling.\n\n\nTheme Assignment\nFollowing topic modeling, each paper is assigned themes by the authors, with typically one to three themes per paper. To validate these assignments, a rule-based text mining approach using TF-IDF is employed. This method verifies theme assignments by counting the occurrences and impact of tokens within each article, allowing for up to three themes to be assigned per paper.\nThe algorithm works by using a pre-defined Python dictionary where each key represents a theme (e.g., “Perceptive,” “Psychological”) and its value is a list of factors associated with that theme. The algorithm calculates a score for each theme in an article based on the frequency of its associated factors. The themes corresponding to the top three highest scores are then assigned to the paper. If there is an overlap between author-assigned themes and algorithm-assigned themes, the matching theme with the highest weight is selected as the main theme. In cases where no themes match, the paper is re-reviewed for a decision. The analysis showed a high agreement rate of 90.2% between manual and rule-based assignments.\nFor a walk through of this part, read Theme Assignment.\n\n\nData Analysis\nThe dataset used for this chapter’s analysis comprises 143 articles published between 2018 and 2024, with significant variation in sample sizes across studies. Key information, such as factors of influence, research type, sample size, methods, and foundational theories, was manually extracted from each paper and stored in a CSV file.\nAn exploratory data analysis revealed several insights into the m-banking adoption literature. Most studies are quantitative (80), followed by empirical (27). The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) are the most dominant theoretical frameworks, accounting for 70% of the literature, suggesting a potential over-reliance on these models. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Partial Least Squares SEM (PLS-SEM) are the most common methodologies used.\nThe most frequently cited limitations in the studies include limited generalizability due to a focus on specific countries, sample-related issues (such as unrepresentative samples), and the lack of longitudinal studies. Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and Trust are among the most frequently identified significant factors. The analysis also investigates non-significant factors and explores patterns in how these factors are reported across different study characteristics. Statistical analyses, such as chi-squared tests, are used to examine relationships between themes, technologies, research types, and other variables.\nFor a walk through of this part, read Data Analysis.",

This model suggests that someone’s attitude towards a technology and their intention to use it are key to adoption. An expanded version, the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT/UTAUT2), adds more factors to explain adoption.\nData Collection: Studies often gather information using surveys filled out by many people. Sometimes, they conduct interviews or focus groups to get deeper insights into people’s experiences.\nAnalysis: They use statistical methods to find relationships between different factors and predict adoption behavior.",

    "text": "4 What Do We Know So Far?\nMany factors influence technology adoption:\n\nUsefulness and Ease of Use: These are consistently found to be the most important factors. If people believe a technology will help them do something better or more effectively (perceived usefulness), and if they believe it will be easy to learn and use without much effort (perceived ease of use), they are much more likely to adopt it.\nTrust: People need to trust the technology, the company providing it, or the information it provides. For example, in mobile banking, security concerns can stop people from using it.\nSocial Influence: What friends, family, or influential people use or say can significantly sway someone’s decision.\nEmotions: Both positive and negative feelings play a big part. For instance, anxiety or fear about using technology can stop people from adopting it, while enjoyment can encourage it.\nPersonal and Situational Factors: Things like a person’s age, gender, prior experience with technology, how open they are to new things, and the specific situation (e.g., during a pandemic) can also affect adoption.",

    "text": "Mobile banking (m-banking) is a service that allows users to perform financial transactions and manage their accounts using a mobile device, such as a smartphone. This technology has gained significant popularity due to its convenience and the increasing use of smartphones. M-banking revolutionizes traditional banking by enabling users to conduct various banking tasks, including paying bills, viewing account balances, and transferring funds, directly from their mobile devices. The accessibility of smartphones, which are daily companions for most people, resolves challenges associated with in-person bank visits, such as queues, commute time and costs, and limited business hours. In Canada, mobile banking has become the most popular banking method. By the last quarter of 2023, 60% of Canadians primarily used m-banking, a notable shift from 2019 when only 53% used mobile devices for banking. This transition highlights m-banking’s growing importance as the primary way Canadians manage their finances.",
