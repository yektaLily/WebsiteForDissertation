This study investigates the impact of Islamic mobile Banking on customers' interests. To explore the phenomenological impact, this study used a qualitative approach by applying in-depth interviews with 15 Islamic M-Banking users from various backgrounds. This study analyzed the data by data reduction, display, and conclusion. The conclusion of this study revealed some positive and negative effects on the users. The positive effect is that it saves time, especially for students and workers who are busy with their daily activities. The available features and facilities such are credit purchases and online Islamic social payments ease them in saving time. However, there are also negative consequences for users. Some customers are susceptible to data theft by irresponsible people and face difficulties in using sophisticated mobile phones that not all customers have. Inconvenience telephone and text messages on behalf of a Bank insulted users of Islamic M-Banking and reduced their comfort. This study recommends that Islamic Banks improve the data security system to ensure customer convenience when using M-Banking. {\copyright} Azhar Alam, Achsania Hendratmi, Mega Santika Wati, Lukmanul Hakim, 2022.},

  abstract = {This study explores the challenges facing the current e-payment systems and investigates the main factors that support using the e-payment system. This study used a cross-sectional approach. An online survey was conducted on Yemeni consumers as part of the collection of data. The data from 486 questionnaires were analyzed using smartPLS4 and Jamovi software for structural model analysis and statistical analysis. According to the PLS-SEM results, the structural model shows that R2 is 0.757, which explains the variances in behavioral intention via all the constructs. Statistically, the intention to use e-payment systems is significantly and positively influenced by performance and effort expectancies and social influence. In contrast, facilitation conditions are significantly and negatively correlated with behavioral intention. This is attributed to consumers' view of the infrastructure of Internet Services, which does not contribute to the behavioral intention and acceptance of using electronic payment in Yemen. Contrary to expectations, age does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy, social influence, and intention to use e-payment systems; hence, the related hypothesis was not supported. This study provides valuable suggestions for policymakers, designers, developers, and researchers, enabling them to better understand the critical aspects of using the electronic payment system. This study developed a model for predicting the likelihood of acceptance of electronic payments in a country that has not given adequate attention to this issue. An application and evaluation of the UTAUT model in Yemen are presented in this study.},

Despite their wide availability, evidence on use comes predominantly from the United States or Global North, with none targeting college student-athletes in low- and middle-income countries. This study was aimed to explore the use of these technologies among student-athletes at the American University of Beirut (AUB). We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 482 participants (average age 20 years) enrolled in 24 teams during Fall 2018; 230 students successfully completed the web-based survey, and 200 provided valid data. Fifty-three (26.5\%) have owned a fitness tracker, mostly for self-monitoring. The most popular were Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Garmin. Similarly, 82 students (40\%) used apps, primarily MyFitnessPal, Apple Health, and Samsung Health. Nevertheless, many participants discontinued use due to loss of interest or technical issues (breaking, usability, obsolescence, or lack of engagement). Wearable devices were considered superior to mobile phones alone as physical activity monitors. However, forming regular habits made self-monitoring via technology irrelevant. Further research is needed to better understand what motivates continuous use among student-athletes, who could use trackers to improve athletic performance and overall health.},

Among non-account holders, more than half are older than 55 years old. A significantly negative association between FI and age/age group is confirmed. We also prove the positive effect of mobile phones and mobile money on FI scores, by 0.48--0.49 percentage points. This study sheds light on the drivers of mobile Banking among the elderly with Thai ICT data, showing that low internet Access and mobile phone use are the biggest barriers to Financial inclusion.

  abstract = {The wide use of mobile phones increases low-income individuals' Access to a large range of Services. one of these Services is mobile Banking (m-Banking). Today, m-Banking represents a key vector of Financial inclusion in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, especially Senegal. Based on technology adoption theories applied to households in developing countries, this paper studies the determinants of the adoption and use of m-Banking. We distinguish between possession or adoption and actual use of m-Banking and examine the interdependence between these two decisions by using the Heckman sample selection model, through a sample of 1,052 individuals in the suburbs of Dakar. Our main results are that the two decisions (adoption and use) are not independent of each other. Individual characteristics, such as education, possession of a Bank account, and family network effects, are determinants of the adoption, and age, gender, and being a member of a tontine are determinants of the use. A major result of this study concerns women's low prOpensity to adopt m-Banking because of their low levels of education. However, compared with men, when women adopt m-Banking, they have a stronger prOpensity to use it. {\copyright} 2020 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

Clients' attitudes toward mobile Banking Services are based on their expectations is the background of this research. So, the main objective is to observe the purposeful conduct in mind of clients to adopt mobile Banking Services. This study also examines the influence of six variables on Financial Services clients' desire to utilize mobile Banking Services, including perceived benefits, perceived ease of use, trust, security, perceived privacy, and technology expertise. Consequently, the goal of this study is to find out the crucial and deciding factors that may influence clients' willingness to use mobile Banking features in Bangladesh as a developing country. The sample shaped for this research is 310 respondents from Bangladesh a developing country. For analytical purposes, SEM has been used to test hypotheses. The results show that in Bangladesh, factors like perceived value, security, and technological aptitude greatly determine whether a customer will utilize mobile Banking. Financial institutions have proven to be successful in serving clients through mobile phones. Clients have made good use of mobile Banking only to save money, cost, and labor. The research suggests that mobile Banking operations must be timely and accurate, the transaction process must be short, interactivity, convenience of usage, and so on. The findings have important implications for Bank regulatory authority, management, Bankers, and executives who wish to increase mobile Banking usage to secure their long-term profitability. {\copyright} 2024 by author(s).},

  abstract = {Mobile Banking allows customers to use mobile devices and smartphones to transact anytime, anywhere. on the other hand, Mobile Banking is a service product that brings high business efficiency, does not cost much, creates initiative for users, reduces pressure on over-the-counter transactions, and has little risk, so developing mobile Banking Services brings excellent benefits to Banks. Therefore, scientific and technological achievements, particularly information technology, electronics, and telecommunications, have significantly impacted daily life, the economy, and society, changing people's awareness and production and business methods in various fields and industries, including Financial Banking Services. To address the aforementioned analytical concerns, the authors surveyed 650 individual consumers who use mobile Banking Services at ten commercial Banks in Vietnam. The article used structural equation modeling and data processing tools SPSS 20.0, Amos. According to the findings, customer satisfaction is influenced by five elements: dependability, responsiveness, empathy, competence, and tangibles. The article's findings had a significant reliability influence on individual customer satisfaction, with a significance level of sig 0.01. Finally, the study's contributions have validated customer satisfaction, service quality ideas, and the need to flexibly implement customer satisfaction research policies. The research results are scientific evidence to help the Banking industry continue to perfect, upgrade, and enhance utilities and service quality for the national payment infrastructure and automatic clearing payment system to serve customers retail transactions in the direction of providing online payment Services, instant processing, and 24/7 continuous operation for all people and businesses. {\copyright} Authors retain all copyrights.},

  abstract = {Background The burden of population aging and chronic conditions has been reported worldwide. Older adults, especially those with high needs, experience social isolation and have high rates of emergency visits and limited satisfaction with the care they receive. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies present opportunities to address these challenges. To date, limited information is available on Canadian older adults' attitudes toward and use of mHealth technologies for self-tracking purposes---an area that is increasingly important and relevant during the COVID-19 era. Objective This study presents contributions to an underresearched area on older adults and mHealth technology use. The aim of this study was to compare older adults' use of mHealth technologies to that of the general adult population in Canada and to investigate the factors that affect their use. Methods A cross-sectional survey on mHealth and digital self-tracking was conducted. A web-based questionnaire was administered to a national sample of 4109 Canadian residents who spoke either English or French. The survey instrument consisted of 3 sections assessing the following items: (1) demographic characteristics, health status, and comorbidities; (2) familiarity with and use of mHealth technologies (ie, mobile apps, consumer smart devices/wearables such as vital signs monitors, bathroom scales, fitness trackers, intelligent clothing); and (3) factors influencing the continued use of mHealth technologies. Results Significant differences were observed between the older adults and the general adult population in the use of smart technologies and internet (P{$<$}.001). Approximately 47.4\% (323/682) of the older adults in the community reported using smartphones and 49.8\% (340/682) indicated using digital tablets. only 19.6\% (91/463) of the older adults using smartphones/digital tablets reported downloading mobile apps, and 12.3\% (47/383) of the older adults who heard of smart devices/wearables indicated using them. The majority of the mobile apps downloaded by older adults was health-related; interestingly, their use was sustained over a longer period of time (P=.007) by the older adults compared to that by the general population. Approximately 62.7\% (428/682) of the older adults reported tracking their health measures, but the majority did so manually. Older adults with one or more chronic conditions were mostly nontrackers (odds ratio 0.439 and 0.431 for traditional trackers and digital trackers, respectively). No significant differences were observed between the older adults and the general adult population with regard to satisfaction with mHealth technologies and their intention to continue using them. Conclusions Leveraging mHealth technologies in partnership with health care providers and sharing of health/well-being data with health care professionals and family members remain very limited. A culture shift in the provision of care to older adults is deemed necessary to keep up with the development of mHealth technologies and the changing demographics and expectations of patients and their caregivers.},

The COVID-19 pandemic further emphasized the need for digital transformation in healthcare, accelerating digital health adoption. This study explores the digital divide between `Digital Natives (20--39 Y)' and `Digital Immigrants (40--69 Y)', focusing on digital device usage and confidence. Methods: This study utilized national survey data from the Digital Health Literacy Survey Results and Policy Implications, focusing on differences in digital device use and confidence between young adults (20--39 Y) and middle-aged adults (40--69 Y). The participants comprised 1000 adults aged 20 to 69 in the Republic of Korea. Respondents were queried about their use of digital health tools, such as wearable devices and mobile apps. Confidence in using digital systems and managing health via digital tools was assessed using a five-point Likert scale. Results: The findings indicated that while young adults have lower rates of using digital devices for healthcare, they exhibit higher confidence in using such devices. In contrast, middle-aged adults, despite having lower confidence, report higher usage of digital devices for healthcare purposes. Conclusions: This study explored differences in digital confidence and healthcare usage between age groups and aimed to propose effective health management strategies based on digital Accessibility.},

  abstract = {Background Research on whether wearable devices and app-based interventions can effectively prevent metabolic syndrome (MetS) by increasing physical activity (PA) among middle-aged people living in the rural areas of South Korea remains insufficient. Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether mobile and wearable device interventions can improve health indicators, including PA, in MetS risk groups in rural South Korea. Methods In this clinical trial, performed from December 2019 to June 2020, participants were asked to use a wearable device (GalaxyWatch Active1) alone (standard intervention) or the wearable device and mobile app (Yonsei Health Korea) (enhanced intervention). Clinical measures and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) scores were evaluated initially and after 6 months. The number of steps was monitored through the website. The primary outcome was the difference in PA and clinical measures between the enhanced intervention and standard intervention groups. The secondary outcome was the decrease in MetS factors related to the change in PA. Results A total of 267 participants were randomly selected, 221 of whom completed the 6-month study. Among the 221 participants, 113 were allocated to the enhanced intervention group and 108 were allocated to the standard intervention group. After 6 months, the body weight and BMI for the enhanced intervention group decreased by 0.6 (SD 1.87) and 0.21 (SD 0.76), respectively (P{$<$}.001). In both groups, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) decreased (P{$<$}.001). The total PA was approximately 2.8 times lower in the standard intervention group (mean 44.47, SD 224.85) than in the enhanced intervention group (mean 124.36, SD 570.0). Moreover, the enhanced intervention group achieved the recommended level of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), whereas the standard intervention group did not (188 minutes/week vs 118 minutes/week). Additionally, the number of participants in the enhanced intervention group (n=113) that reached 10,000 daily steps or more after the intervention increased from 9 (8.0\%) to 26 (23.1\%) (P=.002), whereas this number did not increase significantly in the standard intervention group (n=108), from 8 (7.4\%) to 16 (14.8\%) (P=.72). The number of participants without any MetS factors increased by 12 (11\%) and 8 (7\%) in the enhanced and standard intervention group, respectively. Conclusions PA monitoring and an intervention using wearable devices were effective in preventing MetS in a rural population in Korea. Blood pressure, waist circumference, and HbA1c were improved in both intervention groups, which were effective in reducing MetS factors. However, only the participants in the enhanced intervention group continuously increased their MVPA and step counts above the recommended level to prevent MetS. Body weight and BMI were further improved, and a higher number of participants with zero MetS factors was attained from the enhanced intervention.

Limited research works were conducted on customers' adoption intentions to obtain a real image of the evolution of WPD in China. This study aims to investigate the effects of Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Conditions (FC), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Perceived Trust (PT), and Lifestyle Compatibility (LC) on the intention to adopt WPD among Chinese consumers by expanding unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with two impelling determinants (i.e. PT and LC). Using an online survey, empirical data were collected from 298 respondents in China. In a two-stage data analysis, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) were employed to analyse the causal effects and associations between independent and dependent variables, whereas artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to evaluate the research model prediction capability. The (PLS-SEM) findings indicated that PE, SI, FC, HM, LC, and PT had substantial positive impacts on adoption intention, whilst EE had no impact on adoption intention among Chinese consumers. The ANN analysis proved the high prediction accuracy of data fitness, with ANN findings highlighting the importance of PT, FC, and PE on the intention to adopt WPD. It was suggested that the study findings assist WPD service providers and the smart wearable device industry practitioners in developing innovative products and implementing efficient marketing strategies to attract the existing and potential WPD users in China.},

  abstract = {Abstract Health apps and wearables are touted to improve physical health and mental well-being. However, it is unclear from existing research the extent to which these health technologies are efficacious in improving physical and mental well-being at a population level, particularly for the underserved groups from the perspective of health equity and social determinants. Also, it is unclear if the relationship between health apps and wearables use and physical and mental well-being differs across individualistic, collectivistic, and a mix of individual--collectivistic cultures. A large-scale online survey was conducted in the U.S. (individualist culture), China (collectivist culture), and Singapore (mix of individual--collectivist culture) using quota sampling after obtaining ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB-2021-262) of Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. There was a total of 1004 respondents from the U.S., 1072 from China, and 1017 from Singapore. Data were analyzed using multiple regression and negative binomial regression. The study found that income consistently had the strongest relationship with physical and mental well-being measures in all three countries, while the use of health apps and wearables only had a moderate association with psychological well-being only in the US. Health apps and wearables were associated with the number of times people spent exercising and some mental health outcomes in China and Singapore, but they were only positively associated with psychological well-being in the US. The study emphasizes the importance of considering the social determinants, social--cultural context of the population, and the facilitating conditions for the effective use of digital health technologies. The study suggests that the combined use of both health apps and wearables is most strongly associated with better physical and mental health, though this association is less pronounced when individuals use only apps or wearables.},

Electronic Financial transactions are gradually taking over traditional Banking Services in terms of transferring funds, utility payments, insurance premium, mortgages and even stock trading. Despite the widespread popularity of smartphones and the advantages of mobile Banking, the adoption rates of the mobile apps have been very low all over the world. Our study explored the consumer acceptance of mobile apps in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by using a structured online questionnaire that was designed using standard variables from the Technology Acceptance Model. Principal component analysis was used to identify and score these factors for the subsequent categorical regression analysis. Consumers were assigned numerical categories depending on their level of usage of the app, and the CATREG nonlinear technique was used to determine the significance of technology acceptance factors. The results show that almost two-thirds of the sample were currently using Mobile Banking apps, and they predominantly belonged to the 30--40 age-group. Perceived usefulness and available information were identified as the main factors influencing acceptance and level of usage of mobile Banking apps. This study makes a significant contribution to the existing literature by identifying consumers according to their level of usage and adopting the categorical regression model, which has not been attempted earlier. The results provide important insights for Banking professionals in the UAE, in terms of marketing initiatives, information technology and customer service. {\copyright} 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

Despite the abundance of smart mobile phones, the uptake of mobile Banking among the population remains low. To address this issue, this study integrates four variables---perceived Financial cost, awareness, technology infrastructure support, and government regulations---into the UTAUT framework to explore their impact on driving the adoption of MBS. Based on convenient sampling techniques, it uses 567 valid responses collected through a self-administered questionnaire and applies multiple regression analysis methods for data analysis using SPSS-26 software. Results indicate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, perceived Financial cost, and awareness are significant drivers of behavioral intention to use MBS in China. Technological infrastructure support positively influences performance expectancy, and individuals' intent to use and adopt MBS in China. Government support significantly drives the individual's behavioral intention to use and adopt MBS. Furthermore, behavioral intention to use MBS significantly predicts its adoption in China. The Practical and academic ramifications of MBS on the growth and development of sustainable mobile Banking systems are presented. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2024.},

The hypothesis model is based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with additional factors of the social image, perceived risk and perceived trust adopted from Mu{\~n}oz-Leiva et al. (2017). The methodology in this study includes data collection through questionnaires distributed online and data analysis using the Structural Equation Model. The results of this study illustrate that the perceived trust and perceived risk have a more dominant part in influencing user attitude and user intention to use digital Banking. Meanwhile, social image, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness are not significant in influencing user attitude and user intention to use digital Banking. The implication of this research helps to determine the right communication and strategy so that more users with more benefits can utilize this digital Banking application. {\copyright} 2020.

  abstract = {Fitness sensors and health systems are paving the way toward improving the quality of Mediacal care by exploiting the benefits of new technology. For example, the great amount of patient-generated health data available today gives new opportunities to measure life parameters in real time and create a revolution in communication for professionals and patients. In this work, we concentrated on the basic parameter typically measured by fitness applications and devices---the number of steps taken daily. In particular, the main goal of this study was to compare the accuracy and precision of smartphone applications versus those of wearable devices to give users an idea about what can be expected regarding the relative difference in measurements achieved using different system typologies. In particular, the data obtained showed a difference of approximately 30\%, proving that smartphone applications provide inaccurate measurements in long-term analysis, while wearable devices are precise and accurate. Accordingly, we challenge the reliability of previous studies reporting data collected with phone-based applications, and besides discussing the current limitations, we support the use of wearable devices for mHealth.},

  abstract = {Most adults in the UK and USA are classified as overweight or obese. Recent studies suggest that the prevalence of obesity has further increased during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and associated lockdowns. Digital technologies may be effective at managing obesity and related comorbidities, a potential further justified by social isolation and distancing circumstances. This review of published literature employed a Patient-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome structured approach on the use of digital solutions to determine the effectiveness of their use in the management and treatment of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes and included commercially available, automated devices and applications that did not require intervention from a clinician. Our search covered studies published between January 2004 and February 2019, and 18 papers were included in the final analysis. The digital solutions reviewed were smartphone applications, wearable activity trackers, and `digital medicine offerings' (DMO), including ingestible sensors and wearable patches. This study found that not all interventions were effective at encouraging the lifestyle changes required for the management of obesity. Smartphone applications requiring interaction from the patient appeared to be more effective at encouraging engagement with treatment interventions than more passive wearable activity trackers. Automated feedback from smartphone applications was effective at managing type 2 diabetes, while DMO were effective at reducing blood pressure. With the advancement of new technologies alongside a rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated disorders, further studies comparing the various technologies available in larger sample populations for longer periods would help determine the most cost-effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {The study is set against the backdrop of rapid technological advancements in the Banking sector, specifically in the adoption of mobile Banking. Over the last three decades, the Banking industry in Ghana, like many others in emerging economies, has transitioned from traditional, branch-based Banking Services to more automated and digital solutions. This transformation has been largely driven by increasing internet penetration, mobile phone adoption, and the need to reach underserved populations. Despite these advances, a significant proportion of the population remains Financially excluded, with limited Access to formal Financial Services. Thus, mobile Banking offers an opportunity to enhance Financial inclusion, particularly for marginalised communities in Ghana. The study aims to investigate the factors influencing mobile Banking Services and assess how they impact Financial inclusion among customers of commercial Banks in an emerging economy. The study through the use of a structured questionnaire gathered 65 primary data from managers and supervisors within 13 commercial Banks in Ghana. The study employed a purposive sampling technique to select the 13 commercial Banks whilst using convenience sampling to gather data from managers and supervisors within these Banks. The results show that mobile Banking transfer has a significant negative relationship with Financial inclusion, but mobile account management has a significant positive relationship with Financial inclusion. Furthermore, the results depict that Mobile Banking payment and Financial inclusion have no significant relationship. Policy development should focus on increasing Financial inclusion among unBanked individuals, enabling Access to Banking Services. Commercial Banks should innovate mobile money connections and expand motivation for technical Financial inclusion to provide value-added Services and improve Access to Financial Services, ultimately promoting Financial inclusion. The study shed light on the impact of mobile Banking transfer, mobile Banking payment, and mobile account management on Financial inclusion in Ghana. The study further provides implications for commercial Banks and policymakers in sub-Saharan Africa. {\copyright} 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of information privacy concern arising because of the application of computer-based information system in the various domains (E-Governance, E-Commerce, E-Health, E-Banking and E-Finance), and at different levels, i.e. individual, group, organizational and societal. Design/methodology/approach The authors performed an in-depth analysis of different research articles related to information privacy concerns and elements affecting those at certain level of applications. The primary sources of literature were articles retrieved from online databases. Various online journal and scholarly articles were searched in detail to locate information privacy-related articles. Findings The authors have carried out a detailed literature review to identify the different levels where the privacy is a big challenging task. This paper provides insights whether information privacy concern may obstruct in the successful dispersal and adoption of different applications in various application domains. Consumers' attitude towards information privacy concerns have enlightened and addressed at individual levels in numerous domains. Privacy concerns at the individual level, as suggested by our analysis, seem to have been sufficiently addressed or addressed. However, information privacy concerns at other levels -- group, organizational and societal levels -- need the attention of researchers. Originality/value In this paper, the authors have posited that it will help the researchers to more focus at group level privacy perspective in the information privacy era.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the interplay between data security and consumer trust in the context of fintech innovation, employing the Technology Adoption Model (TAM) as the theoretical framework. Fintech, characterized by its rapid technological advancements, has revolutionized traditional Financial Services, offering convenience and efficiency. However, concerns about data security and privacy have emerged as significant barriers to consumer adoption and trust. The research methodology involves a comprehensive literature review to establish the theoretical foundation and empirical analysis of consumer perceptions through surveys and interviews. The TAM framework, which examines users' attitudes and behaviors towards technology adoption, serves as a lens to understand how data security measures influence consumer trust in fintech platforms. Results indicate that consumers prioritize data security and privacy when evaluating fintech Services, with perceptions of security significantly impacting trust levels. Factors such as encryption protocols, authentication mechanisms, and regulatory compliance play crucial roles in shaping consumer perceptions of data security. Additionally, transparency and communication regarding data handling practices enhance trust and mitigate concerns. The study identifies the role of user experience design in fostering trust, as intuitive interfaces and clear privacy policies contribute to perceived security.

It has been suggested, but not empirically verified, that tablets are best suited for tasks where information is ``consumed'' whereas ``creation'' tasks are better suited to desktop or traditional computers. A survey was administered in order to better understand how tasks may be classified as consumption or creation tasks, and to determine if a relationship exists between this categorization and user preference to complete a task with a tablet or a traditional computer. Participants classified 57 tasks/applications according to consumption/creation dimensions, and according to their preference to complete the task on a tablet or desktop computer. Results indicate creation and consumption are not mutually exclusive categories and that device preference is not directly related to these categories. Results of this work may be used in the further design, development and evaluation of applications across devices.},

  abstract = {The present study investigates to what degree individual differences can predict frequency and duration of actual behaviour, manifested in mobile application (app) usage on smartphones. In particular, this work focuses on the identification of stable associations between personality on the factor and facet level, fluid intelligence, demography and app usage in 16 distinct categories. A total of 137 subjects (87 women and 50 men), with an average age of 24 ( SD = 4.72), participated in a 90--min psychometric lab session as well as in a subsequent 60--day data logging study in the field. Our data suggest that personality traits predict mobile application usage in several specific categories such as communication, photography, gaming, transportation and entertainment. Extraversion, conscientiousness and agreeableness are better predictors of mobile application usage than basic demographic variables in several distinct categories. Furthermore, predictive performance is slightly higher for single factor---in comparison with facet--level personality scores. Fluid intelligence and demographics additionally show stable associations with categorical app usage. In sum, this study demonstrates how individual differences can be effectively related to actual behaviour and how this can assist in understanding the behavioural underpinnings of personality.

This is particularly true for mobile devices, which are now part of the full range of human activity. Our project seeks to discover the conditions under which mobile users are most likely to make security errors, so that we may offer timely encouragement toward safe mobile behavior. Our earlier work indicated that any condition causing stress may increase insecure behavior, with the cause of that stress being relatively unimportant. We therefore focused on multitasking, and asked participants to choose applications to install on the phone, a particularly important security decision. Participants experienced more stress and made more security errors when multi-tasking. This suggests that when mobile users are multi-tasking, designers might create especially effective warnings and guards against error.},

Extant literature on the acceptance of mobile computing has been developing such as in mobile Banking Services and in healthcare service, however, the study of users' acceptance about the emergence of wearable mobile computing is still at the early stages. This paper examines the development of a conceptual framework to understand the technology adoption factors for wearable mobile computing utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) and related factors on mobility and pervasive computing. Data of 272 respondents were collected using quantitative approach of survey based questionnaires conducted in Malaysia. The findings of this research revealed the factors of mobility (MOB), personalization (PN) and perceived enjoyment (PE) achieved the highest average score by respondents, followed by perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU), observability (OBS), facilitating condition (FC) and social influence (SI). As wearable technology is perceived to be pervasive, mobility (MOB) and perceived enjoyment (PE) contribute the dominant factor for usage acceptance, while Perceived Usefulness (PU) from established model TAM, still plays an important factors in predicting innovation adoption of wearable mobile computing. {\copyright} 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objectives Self-monitoring is recommended for individuals with bipolar disorder, with numerous technological solutions available. This study aimed to identify basic components of these solutions that increase engagement with self-monitoring. Methods Participants with bipolar disorder (n = 47) monitored their symptoms with a Fitbit and a smartphone app and were randomly assigned to either review or not review recorded symptoms weekly. We tested whether individuals would better adhere to and prefer monitoring with passive monitoring with an activity tracker compared to active monitoring with a smartphone app and whether individuals would better adhere to self-monitoring if their recorded symptoms were reviewed with an interviewer. Results Monitoring with a smartphone app achieved similar adherence and preference to Fitbit ( P  {$>$}{\textasciitilde}.85). Linear mixed effects modeling found adherence decreased significantly more over the study for the Fitbit (12\% more, P  {$<$}{\textasciitilde}.001) even though more participants reported they would use the Fitbit over a year compared to the app (72.3\% vs 46.8\%). Reviewing symptoms weekly did not improve adherence, but most participants reported they would prefer to review symptoms with a clinician (74.5\%) and on monthly basis (57.5\%) compared to alternatives. Participants endorsed sleep as the most important symptom to monitor, forgetfulness as the largest barrier to self-monitoring, and raising self-awareness as the best reason for self-monitoring. Conclusions We recommend a combined strategy of wearable and mobile monitoring that includes reminders, targets raising self-awareness, and tracks sleep. A clinician may want to review symptoms on a monthly basis. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03358238.},

  abstract = {Background eHealth and social media could be of particular benefit to adults with hearing impairment, but it is unknown whether their use of smart devices, apps, and social media is similar to that of the general population. Objective Our aim is to study whether adults with normal hearing and those with impaired hearing differ in their weekly use of smart devices, apps, and social media; reasons for using social media; and benefits from using social media. Methods We used data from a Dutch cohort, the National Longitudinal Study on Hearing. Data were collected from September 2016 to April 2020 using a web-based questionnaire and speech-in-noise test. The results from this test were used to categorize normal hearing and hearing impairment. Outcomes were compared using (multiple) logistic regression models. Results Adults with impaired hearing (n=384) did not differ from normal hearing adults (n=341) in their use of a smartphone or tablet. They were less likely to make use of social media apps on a smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95\% CI 0.48-0.92; P=.02). Use of social media on all devices and use of other apps did not differ. Adults with hearing impairment were more likely to agree with using social media to stay in touch with family members (OR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.16-2.07; P=.003) and friends (age-adjusted OR 1.35, 95\% CI 1.01-1.81; P=.046). Furthermore, they were more likely to agree with using social media to perform their work (age-adjusted OR 1.51, 95\% CI 1.04-2.18; P=.03). There were no differences in the experienced benefits from social media. Conclusions The potential for eHealth is confirmed because adults with hearing impairment are not less likely to use smart devices than their normal hearing peers. Adults with hearing impairment are less likely to use social media apps on a smart device but not less likely to use social media on all types of internet-connected devices. This warrants further research on the types of social media platforms that adults with hearing impairment use and on the type of device on which they prefer to use social media. Given that participants with hearing impairment are more likely than their normal hearing peers to use social media to perform their work, use of social media may be seen as an opportunity to enhance vocational rehabilitation Services for persons with hearing impairment.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the determinants of user adoption of smartphone fitness apps in context of an emerging economy. Design/methodology/approach The present study uses the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) as the base model along with two additional constructs, i.e. self-efficacy and personal innovativeness. The data collection was done through an online survey, wherein a total of 324 valid responses were obtained for the statistical analysis. All the hypothesized relationships were tested through partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) using an Open source programming language and software environment, i.e. R Software along with plspm-package. Findings Significant predictors of smartphone fitness app adoption intention include effort expectancy, social influence, perceived value, habit and personal innovativeness. Further, this study confirms significant relationship between personal innovativeness and habit, self-efficacy and effort expectancy and effort expectancy and performance expectation. This study reveals that personal innovativeness is the strongest predictor of behavioural intention. Contrary to the expectations, factors like performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and hedonic motivation did not influence behavioural intention. Originality/value This study is one of the few studies to examine the adoption of smartphone fitness apps in an emerging economy context by using extended version of UTAUT2 model. Further, this study shows how new endogenous and exogenous variables (i.e. self-efficacy and personal innovativeness) contribute to better explanatory power of the UTAUT2 framework.},

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual model that combines the modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) with a consumer brand engagement (CBE) model to predict consumers' usage intentions toward contactless payment systems in a developed country. Design/methodology/approach - The authors cooperated with a contactless payment service provider in Finland and reached out to 22,000 customers, resulting in 1,165 usable responses. The collected data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - The study shows that the UTAUT2 and the CBE model together explain approximately 70 percent of the variance in usage intention. Of the predictors, habit and consumers' overall satisfaction have the strongest influence on usage intentions. The model also confirms the positive relationship between intention and use. Practical implications - Understanding the reasons for both the intention to use and the continued use of contactless payments is important for merchants, Banks and other service providers. This study shows which technology adoption factors drive both the intention and the use of contactless payments. The finding that intention is mainly driven by habit and overall satisfaction and not by hedonic reasons indicates that such behaviors are difficult to change. Originality/value - This study is among the first to examine contactless payment usage in a developed market, where over half of all point-of-sale transactions are executed using contactless payment cards and/or cell phones.},

While mediation has been studied by earlier researchers in the context of online commerce, mobile Banking, short message service (SMS) Banking, mobile money, etc., not many studies exist in the context of mobile wallets. Considering the potential of mobile wallets in India, previous relationships from the theories of technology adoption like technology acceptance model (TAM) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) were adapted to investigate the determinants of user attitude and intention towards mobile wallet adoption. Based on data from 744 respondents collected through a survey, partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling was used to test the research model. Convenience sampling was used to select the respondents. The results revealed that out of the nine paths wherein mediation was examined, in two paths full mediation was found while it was partial in the remaining cases. This study extends research in explaining attitude and intention through multiple mediating relationships. The implications for research and practice and future research directions are discussed.},

Design/methodology/approach This study proposes a new adoption model combining two different models including the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and the theory of planned behaviour, which provided relevant contributions for understanding the adoption of wearable technologies. A structural equation modelling approach using analysis of a moment structures 23 software was used to analyse the data collected from 318 respondents. Findings Findings of this study reveals that performance expectancy (beta = 0.28; t = 2.049), facilitating conditions (beta = 0.28; t = 1.989), social influence (beta = 0.23; t = 3.150) and attitude (beta = 0.18; t = 3.246) have a statistically significant impact on behavioural intention. Additionally, behavioural intention (beta = 0.15; t = 2.543) and attitude (beta = 0.15; t = 3.261) have a statistically significant impact on intention to recommend others. However, effort expectancy, price value, hedonic motivation and habit did not have a significant influence on behavioural intention. Practical implications In this study, the understanding of the determinants contributing to teenagers' behavioural intention to use wearable technologies and driving their intention to recommend others to adopt these devices will provide insights to practitioners and decision makers to customize the features of wearable devices to promote sustainable use of these technologies. Originality/value This study is among the first to investigate wearable technologies from behavioural perspectives especially on teenagers in Bangladesh.

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between a set of functional and social-psychological barriers and Bank customers' intention to fully adopt digital payment methods (DPMs). Design/methodology/approach The data were collected via an online questionnaire sent to two samples of Swedish Bank customers, namely, adopters-accepters (i.e. young Bank customers) and adopters-resisters (i.e. a group opposing a cashless society). Hypotheses were tested by applying an ordinal regression model. Findings Regarding the adopters-accepters, privacy and Access barriers can be obstacles to the full adoption of DPMs. The adopters-resisters perceived all five studied barriers as significant, though only the impersonalisation barrier seemed to matter when the barriers were related to their intention to fully adopt DPMs. Moreover, the results suggest that barriers have a stronger negative effect on the intention to fully adopt among those with extensive experience of DPMs. Practical implications Based on the barriers affecting the intention of particular groups of Bank customers to adopt DPMs, Banks could implement customised measures to promote the ongoing development of digital Financial Services. Originality/value In this under-researched area, this study provides empirical knowledge of the influence of various barriers on the intention of Bank customers characterised as adopters-accepters and adopters-resisters to fully adopt DPMs.},

Design/methodology/approach The proposed model extends meta-Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (meta-UTAUT) model with perceived severity and self-efficacy factors affecting consumers' behavioural intention and use behaviour towards mobile payment Services. A convenient sampling technique has been utilized to gather data from a self-administered questionnaire. The data collection was restricted to the online mode to avoid any physical contact considering the COVID-19 situation. Findings The findings revealed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy and perceived severity have a significant positive impact on consumers' attitude; facilitating conditions has a significant positive impact on effort expectancy; self-efficacy has a significant positive impact on effort expectancy; attitude has a significant positive impact on behavioural intention; and behavioural intention has a significant positive impact on use behaviour. Social influence did not confirm any significant relationship. Research limitations/implications The current research study has utilized a non-probability convenient sampling technique to gather data through a self-administered questionnaire. The data collection was restricted to the online mode to avoid any physical contact considering the COVID-19 situation. The respondents were adopters of mobile payment Services. The scope of the study is the COVID-19 context or related chronic diseases context where major preventive mechanisms such as social distancing and avoidance of physical contacts are vital. Originality/value This study has extended the meta-UTAUT model with the COVID-19 context-specific constructs and relationships. The undertaken work has strengthened the explanability of the model. The inclusion of context relevant variables such as perceived severity and self-efficacy and their association with the existing meta-UTAUT framework have enriched the context of the study.

The cardless cash technology delivers a solution that is an improvement over the traditional form of cash delivery. This study explores the influential factors that affect the preference of cardless cash over cards. A cross-sectional survey was utilised to collect both data through a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 521 Bank customers from one of the largest Banks in India participated in the study employing a convenience sampling technique. The responses were analysed using a predictive analytics approach with various statistical and data mining techniques. Customers preferred cardless cash because of its usefulness over the Card rather than perceived ease of use, customer trust, or perceived security. This paper contributes to the Banking world's ways of pre-stage Access to cash, reducing customer contact at ATMs. It highlights the main factors that influence customer's preference towards using cardless cash technology at ATMs, helping Banks spread the newest technology used to provide a Financial instrument that has been here for centuries-cash.},

Research from the USA indicates such a relationship, and we study whether this finding can be generalized to other countries. Motivated by recent changes in EU legislation related to Financial transactions, we also examine willingness to use social media companies for money transfers along with sharing Bank account information with third-party Financial Services. Exploiting data collected from a representative sample of the Norwegian adult population (n = 2202), we identify differences in Financial behaviour and characteristics between users and nonusers of different digital payment methods. In contrast to US studies, we find that mobile payment users were less Financially vulnerable than nonusers and those women were more likely users of digital payment technologies than men. Younger generations and those with low Financial literacy were more Financially vulnerable than others, although we did not find this to be related to the use of mobile payment or other digital payment methods. The results show that there is a need for more research from different countries outside of the USA to obtain an understanding of the consequences of increased digitalization of Financial Services. In addition, as COVID-19 has shifted a vast amount of spending online and these newer payment technologies have become more available, we need to gain a better understanding of how they influence Financial behaviour.},

The adoption of SWH devices is limited, however, compared with other established digital technologies. This study examines the determinants of consumers' adoption of SWH devices. A conceptual model is proposed that incorporates health (health beliefs and health information accuracy) and technology (compatibility and functional congruence) attributes into the technology acceptance model framework. The proposed model was tested in two steps. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was performed with 473 usable responses to test the hypothesized relationships. The artificial neural network (ANN) approach was then applied to validate the outcomes of Step 1. The SEM analysis indicates that all the hypothesized relationships are supported. The ANN analysis further validates the outcomes of the SEM. The findings of this study and the dual-stage SEM-ANN methodology will have a strong impact on the existing literature regarding SWH devices.},

  abstract = {Technology plays an increasingly important role in our daily lives. The use of technology-based healthcare apps facilitates and empowers users to use such apps and saves the burden on the public healthcare system during COVID-19. Through technology-based healthcare apps, patients can be virtually connected to doctors for Mediacal Services. This study explored users' intention and adoption of eDoctor apps in relation to their health behaviors and healthcare technology attributes among Chinese adults. Cross-sectional data were collected through social media, resulting in a total of 961 valid responses for analysis. The hybrid analysis technique of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) analysis was applied. The obtained results revealed the significant influence of eDoctor apps in terms of usefulness, compatibility, accuracy, and privacy on users' intention to use eDoctor apps. Intention and product value were also found to suggestively promote the adoption of eDoctor apps. This study offered Practical recommendations for the suppliers and developers of eHealth apps to make every attempt of informing and building awareness to nurture users' intention and usage of healthcare technology. Users' weak health consciousness and motivation are notable barriers that restrict their intention and adoption of the apps. Mass adoption of eDoctor apps can also be achieved through the integration of the right technology features that build the product value and adoption of eDoctor apps. The limitations of the current study and recommendations for future research are presented at the end of this paper.},

Of late, it is expected that wearable payments will be the norm of mobile payments soon. Recognizing the SW payments as an emerging innovation, this study investigates the consumers' adoption of SW payments. A survey method was used to collect data from SW devices users in Saudi Arabia. For this purpose, online questionnaires were distributed and a total of 269 responses were received within that 243 operational cases were used for data analysis. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was employed to analyze the data. The statistical tools employed for data analysis are SmartPLS 3.0 and SPSS23. The findings show that all hypothesized relationships were supported except the compatibility and perceived ease of use relationship which was found insignificant. Additionally, the moderating role of personal innovativeness on behavioral intention and actual use relationship was also confirmed. Although TAM is an established robust model of technology adoption, however, the integration of technological features like (perceived esthetics, compatibility, and convenience) make it a more vigorous model for adoption of the smart wearable device.},

  abstract = {The smart wearable device is a new breed of mobile device that offers diversified utilities for health, sport, and finance for consumers worldwide. The current study aims to investigate the provocation of the intention to use smart wearable payment devices among Malaysian consumers. The unified theory of technology acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was employed with the cross-sectional survey-based data to explain the adoption of the smart wearable payment device. Furthermore, the UTAUT model was extended with trust and lifestyle compatibility factors to investigate smart wearable payment device adoption. The survey-based data were collected through the online survey and analyzed through the symmetrical modeling approach of partial least squares structural education modeling (PLS-SEM) to evaluate theoretical associations between the study constructs. The fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was employed as an asymmetrical approach. As a result, it was found that the ease of use, lifestyle compatibility, and trust significantly impacted the intention to adopt smart wearable payment devices. However, social influence and facilitating conditions did not support the intention of adopting smart wearable payment devices. Adopting these devices requires policy and infrastructure development to harness the adoption of smart wearable payment devices. This paper is concluded with study limitations and future research suggestions.},

  abstract = {Mobile payments and their applications have grown lucratively across the globe. Yet limited studies have attempted to investigate user's attitude on m-payments and their behavioral intention. Taking this as a research gap, this research investigates the important variables that build a positive attitude, behavioral intention and use towards m-payments by using the meta-UTAUT framework, with Islamic religiosity as a moderating variable. This research follows a single cross-sectional design using a survey methodology. 510 sample was collected from Gulf countries and Structural equation modeling analysis was used to test the pro-posed conceptual model. The results indicate performance expectancy and facilitating conditions are impor-tant variables that structure the dependant variables. Trust is found to be significantly related to behavioral intention and use. Also, Islamic religiosity is found to positively moderating the relationship of behavioral intention to use of m-payments. This research extends the framework of meta-UTAUT with trust and intro-duces Islamic religiosity as a moderating variable. This research contributes extensively to the m-payment literature and theories associated with meta-UTAUT propositions. With in-depth arguments proposed in hypotheses, the propostions contribute to motivation and social learning theories as well.(c) 2022 The Author.

However, few studies have investigated how young retail investors (YRIs) build trust in FRAs. Another neglected area is whether FRAs' universal (''one-size-fit-all'') model will succeed or should take account of cultural dimensions. Based on the initial trust perspective and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, this study develops a conceptual model of YRIs' initial trust in FRAs, testing it in two countries from different parts of the world, i.e., Malaysia and Sweden. The results indicate that trust prOpensity, perfor-mance expectancy, and hedonic motivation address initial trust in FRAs, which in turn drives behavioural intention to use this technology. Although most results are similar in the two countries, there are indications of cultural differences regarding what influences YRIs' initial trust in FRAs.},

We then analyze the relationship between this index and the extensive and intensive usage of two types of payment Services: electronic money (e-money) and mobile payment apps. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find that higher Financial literacy is positively associated with a higher likelihood of adopting ePayment Services. The empirical results suggest that individuals with higher Financial literacy use payment Services more frequently. We also find that risk-averse people are less likely to adopt and use ePayment Services, whereas people with herd behavior tend to adopt and use ePayment Services more. Our empirical results also suggest that the effects of Financial literacy on the adoption and use of ePayment differ among people with different behavioral traits.},

  abstract = {Every day, a multitude of mobile apps are released or updated, resulting in millions of daily downloads, usage, and views. This creates a fascinating phenomenon of user community acceptance and rating of these apps. Some apps are wellreceived by users due to factors such as performance, compatibility, and cost. This study has examined eleven factors that affect the performance of mobile Banking apps like Google Pay, Phone Pay, and Paytm. Factors are identified by conducting a literature survey, analysing user reviews, and seeking expert opinions. It is worth noting that users tend to reject or dislike apps that pose challenges to them due to issues in the apps. Furthermore, the authors have utilized an Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM) approach to develop a hierarchical structure for improvement of individual factors, along with MICMAC (Matrice d'Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliquee a un Classment) analysis, to categorize the identified issues into four groups. Numerous studies have addressed issues related to mobile apps, but the classification or grouping of these issues has often been inadequate. In divergence, this particular research delivers a well-organized classification of issues associated with mobile Banking applications. The issues are grouped into appropriate categories.},

MSMEs are the main channel for the success of the program through various transaction Services provided to customers. This study aims to investigate the determine customers intention to adopt of QRIS e-Payment in Indonesia. Extended of UTAUT Theory will be used to investigate. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was use to analyze the data. Using the purposive sampling technique, this study collected 195 respondents. We found that There are two main variables driving the customer in adopting of QRIS e-payment, namely social influence and facilitating conditions. Meanwhile, the variable performance expectancy and effort expectancy have a positive but insignificant effect. This result implies that In order to increase customer intention to use the QRIS e-payment system by consumers in Indonesia, QRIS service providers need to form a favorable opinion in society by increasing social influence through collaborating with community leaders or important people in their community and facilitating Services that facilitate community adopts QRIS. This will encourage customer intention to adopt of QRIS e-payment and accelerate the migration of cash transactions to non-cash transactions in Indonesia.},

Participants were divided into two groups of customers in Sweden: adopters-accepters, i.e. young Bank customers and adopters-resisters, i.e. members of a formally organized group opposed to a cashless society.FindingsThe findings revealed that only the credibility barrier-breaker could increase the adopters-accepters' intention to fully adopt DPMs. Credibility also seemed to be an important barrier-breaker for the adopters-resisters, as were perceived usefulness and social influence. Additional analyses showed that the impersonalization barrier reduces the impact of the barrier-breakers on DPM adoption.Practical implicationsRetail Banks and merchants can use these results as a guide to what barrier-breakers might affect various customers' intention to fully adopt DPMs, and to act accordingly. The impersonalization barrier also merits attention when creating an emotional connection to customers who use DPMs.Originality/valueThis study provides empirically based knowledge of the influence of barrier-breakers on the intention of customers, categorized as adopters-accepters and adopters-resisters, to fully adopt DPMs, and highlights the importance of maintaining a human touch in the post-COVID-19 digital era.},

  abstract = {The neoBanking and Banking as a Service (BaaS) model implementation by Financial service organizations and FinTech firms require wide-ranging acceptance of digital payment systems. Given the development of digital-only (neo) Banking at nascent stages, especially in developing economies, there is a need to understand their potential adoption by the customers. In this article, we investigate antecedents to customer's intention to adopt digital-only Banks based on their adoption experience with the existing digital payment platforms. From a novel perspective on digital-only Banking, this research advances the extant literature on digital Financial Services by synergistically combining the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology theory and the factors namely attitude, trust, risk, security, and green concern. The structural equation model based on a cross-sectional sample found that the behavioral intention to adopt digital-only Banks is significantly influenced by effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and social influence, in addition to attitude, trust, perceived risk, perceived security, and green concern. This study adds to the growing theoretic debate in the field by stressing the significance of examining given contextual factors in addition to previously established theories for studying purely digital Services. The managers can draw upon the findings for leading the way to the wide-ranging implementation of BaaS.},

Primary data was collected through a representative online survey in Germany (N =1,019). Leveraging the UTAUT2 framework extended with perceived risk, structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to examine adoption intentions and contributing factors. Overall, our results show that smartphone users in Germany are ready to adopt super apps. Performance expectancy and price value are the most influential predictors to explain adoption intentions, while perceived risk has a significant negative impact. Notably, among socio-economic factors, only gender was significant, with males being more likely to adopt super apps. Prospective super app providers should therefore prioritize features that deliver both utility and economic value to consumers. Building trust through transparency and collaborating with local businesses are crucial for success in markets like Germany. Finally, to maximize market penetration as well as increasing acceptance, the needs and preferences of female consumers need to be addressed explicitly.},

This study identifies and examines the cognitive factors influencing the actual usage of Fintech-based digital Banking among customers. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework is applied taking behavioral intentions as the mediator of the study. By following purposive sampling, data was collected through a self-administrative survey and analysis made via Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Findings demonstrate that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, risk, and trust are significant predictors of digital Banking usage. Furthermore, behavioral intentions fully mediate the relationship between these predictors and actual usage. This research holds several Practical implications. The identified predictors, can enable providers to enhance their offerings and meet customer expectations, and recognition of behavioral intentions being a mediator highlights the importance of understanding customers' intentions and motivations to encourage favorable usage behavior; Financial institutions can better promote the adoption and sustained usage of digital Banking Services. The originality of this research lies in examining the cognitive factors affecting the actual usage of fintech-based digital Banking. This unique approach provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms driving customers' usage of digital Banking Services.},

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of smartphone-based diet applications has been driven by the growing prevalence of mobile technology among consumers and their diverse lifestyle preferences. This study seeks to analyze the factors influencing the use of these applications. The conceptual framework combines three models: the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), the DeLone and McLean information system (IS) (D\&M IS) success model, and the protection motivation model. Conducted in Saudi Arabia, the research employed a quantitative methodology with a survey questionnaire administered to 572 customers. The study, validated through partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), identified several significant predictors for the intention to use smartphone diet applications. These include performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), price value (PV), IS, and service quality (SEQ), as well as perceived vulnerability and perceived severity. Contrary to expectations, factors like facilitating conditions (FCs) and hedonic motivation (HM) did not significantly impact behavioral intention. This pioneering study sheds light on the adoption of smartphone diet applications in an emerging economy, offering valuable insights for scholars, developers, and health professionals.},

  abstract = {Reducing preference for cash and supporting the adoption of digital Financial Services can help achieve Financial inclusion while also diminishing economic informality. However, previous evidence suggests that increased Access to formal Banking Services has not resulted in an immediate reduction in usage of informal Services. This paper estimates the effects of mobile phone Banking apps on the demand for cash using unique survey data from Bangladesh and Indonesia. Our models indicate that having Access to a Banking or payment app reduces a variable capturing preference for cash by between 4\% and 10\%. The results are robust to a range of specification checks (including the inclusion/omission of various controls) which suggests that confounding from unobservables is unlikely to be a substantive source of bias. Since cash is the preferred payment mechanism for the poor in developing countries, the results suggest that Access to digital Banking apps may reduce informality within the finance sector, leading to broader development implications.},

This study investigated the key factors influencing the intention to use E-wallets among Generation Z and Millennials in the country, employing an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework. A total of 500 respondents from these demographic groups participated in an online survey featuring 24 indicators, selected through a stratified sampling method. Using Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the analysis revealed that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, social influence, attractiveness of alternatives, perceived trust, perceived security, and perceived value significantly influenced users' intention to adopt E-wallets. Notably, perceived trust emerged as a stronger predictor than perceived value. This research provided valuable insights into the factors shaping user intentions and consumer satisfaction, enhancing the understanding of E-wallet adoption in the industry. Furthermore, the incorporation of the extended TAM strengthened the theoretical framework for studying E-wallet adoption in developing countries like the Philippines.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc globally and still persists even after a year of its initial outbreak. Several reasons can be considered: people are in close contact with each other, i.e., at a short range (1 m), and the healthcare system is not sufficiently developed or does not have enough facilities to manage and fight the pandemic, even in developed countries such as the USA and the U.K. and countries in Europe. There is a great need in healthcare for remote monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms. In the past year, a number of IoT-based devices and wearables have been introduced by researchers, providing good results in terms of high accuracy in diagnosing patients in the prodromal phase and in monitoring the symptoms of patients, i.e., respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, etc. In this systematic review, we analyzed these wearables and their need in the healthcare system. The research was conducted using three databases: IEEE Xplore{\textregistered}, Web of Science{\textregistered}, and PubMed Central{\textregistered}, between December 2019 and June 2021. This article was based on the PRISMA guidelines. Initially, 1100 articles were identified while searching the scientific literature regarding this topic. After screening, ultimately, 70 articles were fully evaluated and included in this review. These articles were divided into two categories. The first one belongs to the on-body sensors (wearables), their types and positions, and the use of AI technology with ehealth wearables in different scenarios from screening to contact tracing. In the second category, we discuss the problems and solutions with respect to utilizing these wearables globally. This systematic review provides an extensive overview of wearable systems for the remote management and automated assessment of COVID-19, taking into account the reliability and acceptability of the implemented technologies.},

Pain of payment plays a significant role in consumer decision making and has attracted substantial scholarly interest in recent years. In this article, we conduct a systematic literature review of the existing work on pain of payment. We advance theory in the field by proposing a new organizing framework that summarizes the antecedents, moderators, and consequences of pain of payment. Furthermore, we provide a formal definition of pain of payment that encompasses all facets of this construct. Subsequently, we identify knowledge gaps and outline research questions that could be explored to improve our understanding of this construct and advance consumer psychology.},

The results show that performance expectancy, and facilitating condition have the most significant influence on the adoption of cashless payments. Perceived technology security also has a strong relationship with the adoption of cashless payment. The results also find that hedonic motivation, social influence, and innovativeness are positively related to the adoption of cashless payments.

E-money represents one such extension, facilitating cashless transactions through mobile applications which has recently bloomed in the Philippines. This research sought to offer valuable insights into the role of digital currency in developing emerging economies by integrating the UTAUT2 model with the Sustainability Theory of Planned Behavior (STPB). This study aimed to assist developing nations in gauging their communities' attitudes towards e-money from a sustainability standpoint. The study involved the analysis of responses from 638 valid participants, employing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The outcomes revealed that effort expectancy ((3: 0.398) significantly influenced e-money adoption, as per the integrated UTAUT2 and STPB framework, followed by other UTAUT2 domains. Subsequently, attitude ((3: 0.368) and subjective norm ((3: 0.273) followed in terms of their impact, alongside perceived behavioral control ((3: 0.26) and the sustainability domains. These findings shed light on users' perception of e-money as a valuable addition to their daily lives, primarily due to its transactional convenience. Users also believe that e-money enhances their ability to achieve personal goals, giving them control over their time and convenience. As a result, these study findings are pertinent for comprehending user intentions, especially within the context of the continuous advancement of technology.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mobile Banking apps have begun to provide non-core functions to users, for example, mobile shopping, identifying nearby activities, and purchasing tickets as an innovation. Nevertheless, few studies have explored the negative impacts of this change (e.g., information overload and unfamiliarity associated with these new Services). By developing and testing a research model with 422 questionnaires collected in China, this study aimed to examine users' psychological and behavioral aspects regarding the non-core features of mobile Banking apps by considering two countervailing constructs: appreciation and fatigue. The results show that the non-core features of mobile Banking apps affect the appreciation emotion positively and affect the fatigue emotion negatively. The different effects of the two opposing constructs on the using behavior are also discussed. This study identifies the partial complementary mediation role of lifestyle fit and function fit with the non-core features of mobile Banking apps. By presenting the necessary condition analysis, this study contributes to identifying the necessary and sufficient effects of both lifestyle fit and function fit on users' using experience evaluation. The findings suggest that, in practice, non-core features of mobile Banking apps can be used as a business strategy to influence users' choice in the mobile context.},

Thus, this study develops and tests a conceptual autonomous vehicle acceptance model that identifies hedonic motivation, trust in autonomous vehicles and social influence as critical determinants of performance expectancy, perceived risk and emotions, which determine travelers' intentions to use autonomous vehicles (AVs) utilizing the Cognitive Appraisal Theory and the Artificially Intelligent Device Use Acceptance model as conceptual frameworks. Findings indicate that trust is the most powerful determinant of performance expectancy and essential to decrease risk perceptions. Furthermore, performance expectancy and hedonic motivation are critical determinants of travelers' positive emotions, which in turn determines the acceptance of AVs. Contribution to theoretical knowledge and implications for practice are provided, and limitations and recommendations for future studies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article analyzes determinants of technology acceptance and their interdependence. It highlights the role of affect in attitude formation toward new technologies and examines how it mediates the influence of stable psychological variables on the technology's acceptability. Based on theory and previous empirical evidence, we develop an analytical framework of attitude formation. We test this framework using survey data on attitudes toward stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), a technology that could be used to counteract global warming. We show that affect is more important than risk and benefit perception in forming judgment about SAI. Negative and positive affect directly alter the perception of risks and benefits of SAI and its acceptability. Furthermore, affect is an important mediator between stable psychological variables---such as trust in governmental institutions, values, and attitudes---and acceptability. A person's affective response is thus guided by her general attitudes and values.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to provide an up-to-date depiction and analysis of the consumer's attitude towards sustainability of fast fashion products in the UK. Four related strands of literature are reviewed to establish a tri-component model of attitude (ABC), i.e., Affective, Behavioural and Cognitive. A wide set of determinants for attitude is identified, including income, price, gender, culture, religion, age, etc. Based on this conceptual framework, an online questionnaire is designed and sent to university students and alumni in the UK, returning 128 valid responses. Both descriptive statistics and regression analysis (oprobit) are employed to shed light on the three components of attitude towards sustainability. It is found that cognitive and behavioural components converge across cultures and religions, but the affective component remains significantly diverse. Employment status contributes to the awareness, decision and feeling of sustainability features, but gender only matters for purchase decisions. In general, there is an improved cognitive and affective awareness of sustainability, but this does not automatically translate to purchase behaviour. Policy interventions like taxes and subsidies are still needed to foster sustainability in the fast fashion industry.},

The study also found that the individual external environmental forces did not significantly influence the formation of a behavioural intention to adopt. Future research to investigate whether and how these external factors influence the subsequent diffusion process may be useful in order to develop a better understanding of the impact of the external environments on innovation diffusion in the industrial market.},

We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

Studies which link cultural characteristics to the frequency of social behaviors are suggested. Numerous studies that may advance social and personality psychology are suggested by this framework. Finally, a more specific section reviews work on cultural factors on interpersonal behavior, when individuals from different cultures interact.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.}
